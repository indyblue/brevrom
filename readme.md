# To set up LibreOffice:

## hyphenation dictionary
```
b/hyph/dict_la-va-github.oxt
```
You should be able to double-click and it will auto install. If this doesn't work, open LibreOffice Writer, and in the menu choose `Tools -> Extensions`, then add.

## opening the `odt` file

These will generally be available in the repository [Releases](https://github.com/indyblue/brevrom/releases). You'll need to download the odt file.

You will also need the images, which are in the repository under `b/Images`. The odt file needs to be in the same place as the Images directory.

## Formatting and exporting as pdf in LibreOffice

- Open the document
- If it tells you it's opened as "read only," click the "edit" button.
- In the menu choose `Tools -> Update -> Update All`. This will update pagination, the Table of Contents, etc.
- Make any desired manual edits, such as inserting additional page breaks etc.
- If manual edits were made, repeat the `Update All` step above to be sure all references are updated.
- In the menu choose `File -> Export as ... -> Export as PDF`, and follow the prompts.
