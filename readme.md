# To set up LibreOffice:

## hyphenation dictionary
```
b/hyph/dict_la-va-github.oxt
```
You should be able to double-click and it will auto install. If this doesn't work, open LibreOffice Writer, and in the menu choose `Tools -> Extensions`, then add.

## Fonts

The primary font used is `FreeSerif`. `Old London` is used for headers and drop caps. `FancyVR` is used for the versicle/responses. All of these fonts are saved in the repository under `b/font`. You will probably want the `TTF` files (True Type Font).

They should be installed in your operating system, so that they will be available for LibreOffice to use. (There are plenty of instructional websites or videos online to help with this process)

## opening the `odt` file

These will generally be available in the repository [Releases](https://github.com/indyblue/brevrom/releases). You'll need to download the odt file.

You will also need the images, which are in the repository under `b/Images`. The odt file needs to be in the same place as the Images directory.

## Formatting and exporting as pdf in LibreOffice

- Open the document
- If it tells you it's opened as "read only," click the "edit" button.
- In the menu choose `Tools -> Update -> Update All`. This will update pagination, the Table of Contents, etc.
- Make any desired manual edits, such as inserting additional page breaks etc.
- If manual edits were made, repeat the `Update All` step above to be sure all references are updated.
- In the menu choose `File -> Export as ... -> Export as PDF`, and follow the prompts.
