<p><font size="4"><b>This project exists to provide a way for people to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of Divine Office, according to the 1962 Rite.</b></font></p>
<p>All of the following books are offered at the cost of printing, and PDF versions are available for free download.</p>
<br />

<p><font size="3"><b>**Note**</b> I have made every effort to ensure that the text and rubrics are consistent with the 1962 Roman Breviary, and have attempted to use text from sources bearing an Impimatur when possible.  However, this work does not currently have any Ecclesiastical approval.  As such, I can only recommend it as a reference work, not as a "liturgical book," or as a "Book of prayers for the public or private use of the faithful."</font></p>
