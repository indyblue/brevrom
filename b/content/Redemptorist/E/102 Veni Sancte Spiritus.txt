Come, Holy Ghost,
Fill the hearts of Thy faithful,
And kindle in them the fire of Thy love.
V. Send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created.
R. And Thou shalt renew the face of the earth.

Let us pray
O God, Who hast taught the hearts of Thy faithful by the light of Thy Holy Spirit; grant us by the same Spriti, to be truly wise, and ever to rejoice in His consolation. Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

Hail Mary.
