Let us pray.
Protect, O Lord, thy people; and perpetually conserve us by the protection of the Apostles Peter and Paul and the other Apostles.
May all Thy Saints, O Lord, we beseech Thee, help us in every place, that whilst we recall their merits, we may feel their patronage. Vouchsafe, also, Thy peace to our times, and ward off all iniquity from Thy Church. Direct our path, our acts and wills, and those of all Thy servants, in the sure way of Thy salvation. Recompense our benefactors with everlasting good things, and grant to all the faithful departed eternal rest. Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
