The Particular Examen

The Superior (Rector) begins the Veni, Sance Spiritus, and the Community continues the prayer--but the Ave Maria is not added.

Here each one examines his conscience according to the manner pointed out by his spiritual director. At a sign from the Superior the Litany (of Our Lady) of Loreto is said for our benefactors: the responses are "Miserere eis" and "Ora pro eis" ("Have mercy on them", and "Pray for them").

at mid-day the Angelus (or Regina Caeli) is said according to the season, when the bell rings for its recitation.
