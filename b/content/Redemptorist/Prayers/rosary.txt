Salvator Mundi
?

I unite with all the Saints in Heaven, with all the just on earth, and with all the faithful here present in order to praise Thy Holy Mother worthily. I renounce all distractions which may occur during this Rosary. I desire to say it with attention and devotion, as if it were the last of my life.

We offer this Creed, this Our Father and these three Hail Marys in honour of all the mysteries of our Faith, of the unity of Thy essence and the Trinity of Thy persons.  Through it may we obtain a lively faith, a firm hope, and an ardent charity. Amen.
