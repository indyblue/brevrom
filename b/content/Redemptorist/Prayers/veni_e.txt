Come, Holy Ghost,
Fill the hearts of Thy faithful,
And kindle in them the fire of Thy love.
V. Send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created.
R. And Thou shalt renew the face of the earth.

Let us pray
O God, Who hast taught the hearts of Thy faithful by the light of Thy Holy Spirit; grant us by the same Spriti, to be truly wise, and ever to rejoice in His consolation. Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

Hail Mary.

Ant. Angels, Archangels, Thrones and Dominations,* Principalities and Powers, Virtues of the Heavens, Cherubim and Seraphim,* Patriarchs and Prophets, holy Doctors of the Law,* Apostles, all ye Martyrs of Christ,* holy Confessors, Virgins of the Lord,* Anchorets and all Saints, intercede for us.
V. The Saints shall rejoice in glory.
R. They shall be glad in the places of their rest.

Let us pray.
Protect, O Lord, thy people; and perpetually conserve us by the protection of the Apostles Peter and Paul and the other Apostles.
May all Thy Saints, O Lord, we beseech Thee, help us in every place, that whilst we recall their merits, we may feel their patronage. Vouchsafe, also, Thy peace to our times, and ward off all iniquity from Thy Church. Direct our path, our acts and wills, and those of all Thy servants, in the sure way of Thy salvation. Recompense our benefactors with everlasting good things, and grant to all the faithful departed eternal rest. Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
