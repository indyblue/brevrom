ON MAUNDAY THURSDAY / GOOD FRIDAY
the following only is said, during which all genuflect:--

V. Christus factus est pro nobis obediens
R. Usque ad mortem.
(On Good Friday, the following is added)
R. Mortem autem crucis.

V. Christ, for our sake, became obedient.
R. Unto death.
(On Good Friday, the following is added)
R. Even the death of the cross.

An Our Father is then said privately, and the meal blessed by making a simple cross.
The same prayer with genuflection and an Our Father is said at the end of the meal.  The Miserere is recited on leaving the refectory, but the Gloria Patri is not added. When all have assembled in the chapel, the Superior says:--

Respice, quesumus Domine, super hanc familiam tuam, pro qua Dominus noster Jesus Christus non dubitavit manibus tradi nocentium et crucis subire tormentum.

Look down, we beseech Thee, O Lord, upon this Thy family, for which our Lord Jesus Christ hesitated not to be delivered up to the hands of wicked men and to undergo the torment of the cross.
