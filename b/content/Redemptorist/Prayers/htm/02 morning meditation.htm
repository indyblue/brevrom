II. The Morning Meditation

The Angelus is said in common as follows:
<a link=angelus.txt>Angelus</a> (<a link=angelus_e.txt>English</a>)

After giving the blessing, the Rector begins the Antiphon: Veni, Sancte Spiritus, which all continue to recite together. All join in the Antiphon: Angeli, Archangeli
<a link=veni.txt>Veni, Sancte Spritus</a> (<a link=veni_e.txt>English</a>)

<a link=angeli_archangeli.txt>Angeli, Archangeli</a> (<a link=angeli_archangeli_e.txt>English</a>)


Having finished these prayers, each one makes the preparatory acts; then he who has been appointed for this office reads the first point of the meditation in a loud and clear voice. The second point he reads about the middle of the meditation.
Three or four minutes before the end of the meditation the reader gives a sign - by knocking thrice upon the bench - so that each one may make the concluding acts.

After a short interval he says:
Let us recommend to God the Holy Church, and the spiritual and temporal wants of the Congregation.
After the meditation the Superior begins the Salve Regina which is continued by the entire Community, together with the antiphon Princeps gloriosissime.

<a link=princeps.txt>Princeps gloriosissime</a> (<a link=princeps_e.txt>English</a>)


The Hebdomadarius then says:-
A Pater and an Ave in honour of the Apostle St. (N.), and for the conversion of sinners.

Jan:  Ss. Peter and Paul, Apostles.
Feb:  St. Andrew, Apostle.
Mar:  St. James the Great, Apostle.
Apr:  St. John, Apostle and Evangelist.
May:  St. Thomas, Apostle.
Jun:  St. James the Less, Apostle.
Jul:  St. Philip, Apostle.
Aug:  St. Bartholomew, Apostle.
Sep:  St. Matthew, Apostle and Evangelist.
Oct:  St. Simon, Apostle.
Nov:  St. Thaddaeus, Apostle.
Dec:  St. Matthias, Apostle.

1. The Steps of the Passion:
On all Fridays, from the Purification to Advent, the prayer called The Steps of the Passion is said after the morning meditation. The hebdomadarius recites the invocations, the Community responding after each: 
Miserere nostri, Domine, miserere nostri.
(Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us.)

2. Steps of Our Saviour's Childhood
Instead of the foregoing, the Steps of the Holy Infancy are said from the first Friday of Advent till the Purification. Here the response is:
Miserere nostri, Jesu Infans, miserere nostri.
(Have mercy upon us, O Infant Jesus, have mercy upon us.)
