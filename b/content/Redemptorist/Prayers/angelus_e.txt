The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary:
And she conceived by the Holy Spirit.
Hail Mary.

Behold the handmaid of the Lord:
Be it done unto me according to thy Word.
Hail Mary.

And the Word was made flesh:
And dwelt among us.
Hail Mary.

V. Pray for us, Oh Holy Mother of God
R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

Let us pray.
Pour forth, we beseech thee O Lord, Thy grace into our hearts, that we to whom the Incarnation of Christ Thy Son was made known by the message of an Angel, may, by his Passion and Cross, be brought to the glory of the Resurrection, through the same Christ Our Lord.
R. Amen.

The Angelus is said standing on Saturday evening and throughout Sunday; on other days it is said kneeling.

During the Paschal time, i.e., from Holy Saturday until midday of the Saturday before Trinity Sunday, instead of the Angelus, the Regina Caeli is said standing.

The Regina Caeli Laetare

Joy to Thee, O Queen of Heaven! Alleluia.
He Whom Thou wast meet to bear, Alleluia.
As He promised, hath arisen: Alleluia.
Pour for us to Him thy prayer. Alleluia.

V. Rejoice and be glad, O Virgin Mary. Alleluia.
R. For the Lord is truly risen. Alleluia.

Let us pray
O God, who by the resurrection of Thy Son Our Lord Jesus Christ, hast vouchsafed to give joy to the world: grant, we beseech Thee, that through His Virgin Mother Mary we may obtain the joys of eternal life: through the same Christ Our Lord.
R. Amen.
