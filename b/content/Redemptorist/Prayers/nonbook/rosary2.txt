The Most Holy Rosary
Of the Blessed Virgin Mary
The Method of St. Louis de Montfort

V. Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World)
R. Salva Russiam (Saviour of Russia)

I unite with all the saints in Heaven, with all the just on earth, with all the faithful here present, and with Thee, O my Jesus, in order to praise Thy holy Mother worthily, and to praise Thee in her and through her.  I renounce all distractions which may arise during this rosary. I desire to say it with attention and devotion, as if it were the last of my life. 

We offer Thee, O most Holy Trinity, this Creed in honour of all the mysteries of our Faith: this Our Father and these three Hail Marys in honour of the unity of Thy Essence and the trinity of Thy Persons.  We ask of Thee a lively faith, a firm hope and an ardent charity. Amen.

Creed. Our Father. Hail Mary (x3). Glory be.

Hail, Holy Queen.
Let us pray.
O God, whose only begotten Son, by His life, death, and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech Thee, that meditating upon these mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen. 

FATIMA PRAYERS:
My God, I believe, I adore, I hope and I love Thee.  I ask pardon for those who do not believe, do not adore, do not hope and do not love Thee.

Most Blessed Trinity--Father, Son, and Holy Ghost--I adore thee profoundly.  I offer Thee the most precious Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ, present in all the tabernacles of the world, in reparation for the outrages, sacrileges and indifference by which He is so much offended.  And through the infinite merits of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I beg of Thee the conversion of poor sinners.

Most Sacred Heart of Jesus...Have mercy on us. (x3)
Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary...Pray for us. (x3)
Our Mother of Perpetual Succor...Pray for us.
St. Joseph.
St. Alphonsus.
(other saints)
Holy Guardian Angels...watch over us.
Archangels, Angels, Saints in Heaven and Souls in Purgatory...Pray for us.

Prayers for the intentions of our Holy Father:
Our Father. Hail Mary. Glory be.

May the Divine assistance remain with us always.
And may the Souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen.
