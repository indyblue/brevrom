Morning Prayer

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. O my God, prostrate in Thy presence, I adore Thy boundless Majesty, I love Thine infinite Goodness above all things, and I thank Thee with my whole heart for all the blessings Thou hast bestowed on me, especially for having preserved me during the past night. I consecrate to Thee, in union with the merits of Jesus Christ, all my thoughts, all my words and works, and all the sufferings of this day; and I intend that every thought, word, and work, and suffering shall be for Thy greater glory, in reparation to the Immaculate Heart of Mary and in honour of:

Sun:  All my Holy Patrons.
Mon:  My Guardian Angel.
Tue:  The Infant Jesus.
Wed:  St. Joseph.
Thu:  The Most Holy Sacrament.
Fri:  The Passion of Our Lord.
Sat:  The Most Blessed Virgin.

I intend also to gain all the indulgences that I can, in favour of the souls in Purgatory. I purpose to do all that is prescribed by the Rule according to the intention of the Rule, and all else I offer to obtain (N). O my God, for the love of Jesus Christ, preserve me from all sin. My Jesus, by Thy merits grant that I may live always united to Thee. Mary, my Mother, bless me and protect me under thy mantle. My Holy Guardian Angel, and all my Holy Patrons, intercede for me. Amen.

Then say three Hail Marys in honour of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin, adding after each Hail Mary:
"By thy pure and Immaculate Conception, O Mary, make my body pure and my soul holy. My Mother preserve me this day from mortal sin."
and an Our Father and a Hail Mary in honour of your Patron for the year.
