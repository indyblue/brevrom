Hail, holy Queen, mother of mercy, hail, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this vale of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us; and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of Thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.

Ant. Most glorious Prince, Michael the Archangel, be mindful of us: here and everywhere pray always for us to the Son of God.

V. In the presence of the Angels will I sing praise unto Thee, O my God.
R. I will worship towards Thy holy Temple, and praise Thy Name.

Let us pray.
O God, Who, in the dispensation of Thy Providence, dost admirably dispose the ministry of Angels and of men: mercifully grant that they who ever minister before Thy throne in heaven, may also be the protectors of our life on earth. Through Christ Our Lord. Amen.
