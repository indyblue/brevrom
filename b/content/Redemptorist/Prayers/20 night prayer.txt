NIGHT PRAYER

O Lord my God, I thank Thee for having preserved me this day, and I beseech Thee to vouchsafe to preserve me also this night, and to protect me from all evil. I take this repose in order to please Thee, and I intend to love and praise Thee each moment that I breathe, as the Saints and Elect praise and love Thee in heaven. Mary, my Mother, bless me and protect me under thy mantle. My Angel Guardian, and all my holy Patrons, intecede for me.

Then say three Hail Marys in honour of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin, adding after each Hail Mary:
"By thy pure and Immaculate Conception, O Mary, make my body pure and my soul holy. My Mother preserve me this night from mortal sin."
and an Our Father and a Hail Mary in honour of your Patron for the year.
