      inhonéste revertebátur de Pérside.  Intráverat enim in eam quæ 
      dícitur Persépolis, et tantávit exspoliáre templum et civitátem opprímere; 
		sed, multitúdine ad arma concurrénte, in fugam versi sunt, et ita 
      cóntigit ut Antíochus post fugam túrpiter redíret.  Et, cum venísset 
      circa Ecbátanam, recognóvit quæ erga Nicánorem et Timótheum gesta sunt.  
      Elátus autem in ira arbitrabátur se injúriam illórum qui se fugáverant 
      posse in Judǽos retorquére, ideóque jussit agitári currum suum sine 
      intermissióne agens iter, cælésti eum judício perurgénte, eo quod ita

		'About that time came Antiochus with dishonour out of 
      the country of Persia, for he had entered the city called Persepolis, and 
      went about to rob the temple, and to hold the city; whereupon the 
      multitude running to defend themselves with their weapons put them to 
      flight; and so it happened, that Antiochus being put to flight of the 
      inhabitants returned with shame.  Now when he came to Ecbatane, news 
      was brought him what had happened unto Nicanor and Timotheus.  Then 
      swelling with anger. he thought to avenge upon the Jews the disgrace done 
      unto him by those that made him flee. Therefore commanded he his 
      chariotman to drive without ceasing, and to dispatch the journey, the 
      judgment of God now following him. For he had spoken proudly in this sort, 
      That he would come to Jerusalem and make it a common burying place of the 
      Jews.'];
$e1r = ['The Lord open your hearts in his law and 
      commandments, and send you peace in your days: * May 
      he grant you salvation and redeem you out of all evil.',

      one with you, and never forsake you in the time of trouble.'];

		'But he that seeth all, the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, smote him 
      with an incurable and invisible plague: or as soon as he had spoken these 
      words, a pain of the bowels that was remediless came upon him, and sore 
      torments of the inner parts; and that most justly: for he had tormented 
      other men\'s bowels with many and strange torments.  Howbeit he 
      nothing at all ceased from his bragging, but still was filled with pride, 
      breathing out fire in his rage against the Jews, and commanding to haste 
      the journey: but it came to pass that he fell down from his chariot, 
      carried violently; so that having a sore fall, all the members of his body 
      were much pained.'];

      with you, and never forsake you in the time of trouble,  *

		'And thus he that a little afore thought he might 
      command the waves of the sea, (so proud was he beyond the condition of 
      man) and weigh the high mountains in a balance, was now cast on the 
      ground, and carried in an horselitter, shewing forth unto all the manifest 
      power of God.  So that the worms rose up out of the body of this 
      wicked man, and whiles he lived in sorrow and pain, his flesh fell away, 
      and the filthiness of his smell was noisome to all his army.  And the 
      man, that thought a little afore he could reach to the stars of heaven, no 
      man could endure to carry for his intoleráble stink.'];
$e3r = ['Our enemies are gathered together, and make 
      their boast of their own strength: O Lord, break their power and scatter 
      them;
      * That they may know that there is none other 
      that fighteth for us, but only thou, O God.',
      'Scatter them in thy strength, and 
      destroy them, O Lord our 
      defence.'];
