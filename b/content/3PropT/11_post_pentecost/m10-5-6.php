		'Now Maccabeus and his company, the Lord guiding them, 
      recovered the temple and the city: but the altars which the heathen had 
      built in the open street, and also the chapels, they pulled down.  
      And having cleansed the temple they made another altar, and striking 
      stones they took fire out of them, and offered a sacrifice after two 
      years, and set forth incense, and lights, and shewbread.  When that 
      was done, they fell flat down, and besought the Lord that they might come 
      no more into such troubles; but if they sinned any more against him, that 
      he himself would chasten them with mercy, and that they might not be 
      delivered unto the blasphemous and barbarous nations.  Now upon the 
      same day that the strangers profaned the temple, on the very same day it 
      was cleansed again, even the five and twentieth day of the same month, 
      which is Casleu.'];
$e1r = ['Be ye not afraid of the assault of the enemy; but rather remember 
		how our fathers were given deliverance: *  
      Now therefore let us cry unto heaven, if peradventure the Lord will have 
      mercy upon us.',
      'Remember the marvellous works that he 
      hath done to Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea.'];

		'Now Timotheus, whom the Jews had overcome before, when 
      he had gathered a great multitude of foreign forces, and horses out of 
      Asia not a few, came as though he would take Jewry by force of arms.  
      But when he drew near, they that were with Maccabeus turned themselves to 
      pray unto God, and sprinkled earth upon their heads, and girded their 
      loins with sackcloth, and fell down at the foot of the altar, and besought 
      him to be merciful to them, and to be an enemy to their enemies, and an 
      adversary to their adversaries, as the law declareth.  So after the 
      prayer they took their weapons, and went on further from the city: and 
      when they drew near to their enemies, they kept by themselves.'];
$e2r = ['Lo, the heathen are assembled together 
      against us to destroy us, and we know not what to do!  * 
      O Lord God, our eyes are upon thee that we perish not.',
      'What things they imagine against us, 
      thou knowest!  How shall we be able to stand against them, except 
      thou, O God, be our help?'];

		'Now the sun being newly risen, they joined both 
      together; the one part having together with their virtue their refuge also 
      unto the Lord for a pledge of their success and victory: the other side 
      making their rage leader of their battle, but when the battle waxed 
      strong, there appeared unto the enemies from heaven five comely men upon 
      horses, with bridles of gold, and two of them led the Jews, and took 
      Maccabeus betwixt them, and covered him on every side weapons, and kept 
      him safe, but shot arrows and lightnings against the enemies: so that 
      being confounded with blindness, and full of trouble, they were killed.  
      And there were slain of footmen twenty thousand and five hundred, and six 
      hundred horsemen.  As for Timotheus himself, he fled into a very 
      strong hold, called Gawra, where Chereas was governor.'];
$e3r = ['Thine, O Lord, is the power, thine is the 
      kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted above all the heathen: * 
      Give peace in our time, O Lord.',

      art fearful and strong, righteous and merciful.'];
