      hæc cum adoléscens nequáquam inclinarétur, vocávit rex matrem et suadébat 
      ei ut adolescénti fíeret in salútem.  Cum autem multis eam verbis 
      esset hortátus, promísit suasúram se fílio suo; ítaque inclináta ad illum, 
      irrídens crudélem tyránnum ait pátria voce: Fili mi, miserére mei, quæ te

		'Now Antiochus, thinking himself despised, and 
      suspecting it to be a reproachful speech, whilst the youngest was yet 
      alive, did not only exhort him by words, but also assured him with oaths, 
      that he would make him both a rich and a happy man, if he would turn from 
      the laws of his fathers; and that also he would take him for his friend, 
      and trust him with affairs.  But when the young man would in no case 
      hearken unto him, the king called his mother, and exhorted her that she 
      would counsel the young man to save his life.  And when he had 
      exhorted her with many words, she promised him that she would counsel her 
      son.  But she bowing herself toward him, laughing the cruel tyrant to 
      scorn, spake in her country language on this manner; O my son, have pity 
      upon me that bare thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee such three 
      years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age, and endured 
      the troubles of education.'];
$e1r = ['The sun shone upon the shields of gold, and 
      the mountains glistered therewith: *  
      And the army of the heathens was spread abroad.',
		'For the army was very great and mighty; 
      then Judas and his host drew near and entered into battle.'];

$e2 = ['lr|2|Chap. 7, 28-33',
		'I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the 
      earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things 
      that were not; and so was mankind made likewise.  Fear not this 
      tormentor, but, being worthy of thy brethren, take thy death that I may 
      receive thee again in mercy with thy brethren.  Whiles she was yet 
      speaking these words, the young man said, Whom wait ye for? I will not 
      obey the king’s commandment: but I will obey the commandment of the law 
      that was given unto our fathers by Moses.  And thou, that hast been 
      the author of all mischief against the Hebrews, shalt not escape the hands 
      of God.  For we suffer because of our sins.  And though the 
      living Lord be angry with us a little while for our chastening and 
      correction, yet shall he be at one again with his servants.'];
$e2r = ['They decked the forefront of the temple with 
      crowns of gold, and dedicated the altar unto the Lord:  * 
      And there was very great gladness among the people.',
      'They praised the Lord with Psalms and 
      thanksgiving.'];

$e3 = ['lr|3|Chap. 7, 34-41',
		'But thou, O godless man, and of all other most wicked, 
      be not lifted up without a cause, nor puffed up with uncertain hopes, 
      lifting up thy hand against the servants of God: for thou hast not yet 
      escaped the judgment of Almighty God, who seeth all things.  For our 
      brethren, who now have suffered a short pain, are dead under God’s 
      covenant of everlasting life: but thou, through the judgment of God, shalt 
      receive just punishment for thy pride.  But I, as my brethren, offer 
      up my body and life for the laws of our fathers, beseeching God that he 
      would speedily be merciful unto our nation; and that thou by torments and 
      plagues mayest confess, that he alone is God; and that in me and my 
      brethren the wrath of the Almighty, which is justly brought upon our 
      nation, may cease.  Then the king, being in a rage, handed him worse 
      than all the rest, and took it grievously that he was mocked.  So 
      this man died undefiled, and put his whole trust in the Lord.  Last 
      of all after the sons the mother died.'];
$e3r = ['They praised the Lord with Psalms and 
      thanksgiving,
      * Who had done so great things in Israel, and 
      given them the victory, the Lord Almighty.',

      crowns of gold, and dedicated the altar unto the Lord.'];
