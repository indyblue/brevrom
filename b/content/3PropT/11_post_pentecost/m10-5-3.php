      ad illudéndum et, cute cápitis ejus cum capíllis abstrácta, interrogábant, 
      si manducáret prius quam toto córpore per membra síngula punirétur.  
      At ille respóndens pátria voce dixit: Non fáciam.  Propter quod et 
      iste sequénti loco primi torménta suscépit et in último spíritu 
      constitútus sic ait: Tu quidem, scelestíssime, in præsénti 
      vita nos perdis, sed Rex mundi defúnctos nos pro suis légibus in ætérnæ 
      vitæ resurrectióne suscitábit.  Post hunc tértius illúditur; et 
      linguam postulátus cito prótulit et manus constánter exténdit et cum 
      fidúcia ait: E cælo ista possídeo, sed propter Dei leges nunc hæc ipsa 
      despício, quóniam ab ipso me ea receptúrum spero; ita ut rex et qui cum 
      ipso erant miraréntur adolescéntis ánimum, quod tamquam níhilum dúceret

      torquéntes; et, cum jam esset ad mortem, sic ait: Pótius est ab 
      homínibus morti datos spem exspectáre a Deo íterum ab ipso resuscitándos; 
      tibi enim resurréctio ad vitam non erit.  Et, cum admovíssent quintum, 
      vexábant eum.  At ille respíciens in eum dixit: Potestátem inter 
      hómines habens, cum sis corruptíbilis, facis quod vis; noli autem putáre 
      genus nostrum a Deo esse derelíctum.  Tu autem patiénter sústine 
      et vidébis magnam potestátem ipsíus, quáliter te et semen tuum torquébit.  
      Post hunc ducébant sextum, et is mori incípiens sic ait: Noli frustra 
      erráre; nos enim propter nosmetípsos hæc pátimur peccántes in Deum 
      nostrum, et digna admiratióne facta sunt in nobis.  Tu autem ne 
      exístimes tibi impúne futúrum, quod contra Deum pugnáre tentáveris.'];

		'So when the first was dead after this number, they 
      brought the second to make him a mocking stock: and when they had pulled 
      off the skin of his head with the hair, they asked him, Wilt thou eat, 
      before thou be punished throughout every member of thy body?  But he 
      answered in his own language, and said, No. Wherefore he also received the 
      next torment in order, as the former did.  And when he was at the 
      last gasp, he said, Thou like a fury takest us out of this present life, 
      but the King of the world shall raise us up, who have died for his laws, 
      unto everlasting life.  After him was the third made a mocking stock: 
      and when he was required, he put out his tongue, and that right soon, 
      holding forth his hands manfully.  And said courageously, These I had 
      from heaven; and for his laws I despise them; and from him I hope to 
      receive them again.  Insomuch that the king, and they that were with 
      him, marvelled at the young man’s courage, for that he nothing regarded 
      the pains.'];
$e1r = ['This is a lover of the brethren, and of the 
      people of Israel: *  This is one who 
      prayeth much for the people, and for all the Holy City, Jerusalem.','There appeared a man most gentle toward 
      all his people.'];

		'Now when this man was dead also, they tormented and 
      mangled the fourth in like manner.  So when he was ready to die he 
      said thus, It is good, being put to death by men, to look for hope from 
      God to be raised up again by him: as for thee, thou shalt have no 
      resurrection to life.  Afterward they brought the fifth also, and 
      mangled him.  Then looked he unto the king, and said, Thou hast power 
      over men, thou art corruptible, thou doest what thou wilt; yet think not 
      that our nation is forsaken of God; but abide a while, and behold his 
      great power, how he will torment thee and thy seed.  After him also 
      they brought the sixth, who being ready to die said, Be not deceived 
      without cause: for we suffer these things for ourselves, having sinned 
      against our God: therefore marvellous things are done unto us.  But 
      think not thou, that takest in hand to strive against God, that thou shalt 
      escape unpunished.'];
$e2r = ['Thou, O Lord of all things, who hast need of 
      nothing, wast pleased that the temple of thine habitation should be among 
      us;  * 
      Therefore now, O Lord, keep this house ever undefiled.','Thou, O Lord, didst choose this house, 
      that thy Name should be called on therein, and to be an house of prayer 
      and petition for thy people.'];

		'But the mother was marvellous above all, and worthy of 
      honourable memory: for when she saw her seven sons slain within the space 
      of one day, she bare it with a good courage, because of the hope that she 
      had in the Lord.  Yea, she exhorted every one of them in her own 
      language, filled with courageous spirits; and stirring up her womanish 
      thoughts with a manly stomach, she said unto them, I cannot tell how ye 
      came into my womb: for I neither gave you breath nor life, neither was it 
      I that formed the members of every one of you; but doubtless the Creator 
      of the world, who formed the generation of man, and found out the 
      beginning of all things, will also of his own mercy give you breath and 
      life again, as ye now regard not your own selves for his laws’ sake.'];
$e3r = ['Open thine eyes, O Lord, and behold our 
      affliction: for the heathen are come round about us to punish us:
      * But thou, O Lord, stretch forth thine arm, 
      and deliver our souls.','Blessed be the Lord, who hath created 
      the heaven and the earth, because that he hath so glorified thy name this 
      day.'];
