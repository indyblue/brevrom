      of a well favoured countenance, was constrained to open his mouth, and to 
      eat swine’s flesh.  But he, choosing rather to die gloriously, than 
      to live stained with such an abomination, spit it forth, and came of his 
      own accord to the torment, as it behoved them to come, that are resolute 
      to stand out against such things, as are not lawful for love of life to be 
      tasted.  But they that had the charge of that wicked feast, for the 
      old acquaintance they had with the man, taking him aside, besought him to 
      bring flesh of his own provision, such as was lawful for him to use, and 
      make as if he did eat of the flesh taken from the sacrifice commanded by 
      the king; that in so doing he might be delivered from death, and for the 
      old friendship with them find favour.

      head, whereon was come, and his most honest education from a child, or 
      rather the holy law made and given by God: therefore he answered 
      accordingly, and willed them straightways to send him to the grave.  
      For it becometh not our age, said he, in any wise to díssemble, whereby 
      many young persons might think that Eleazar, being fourscore years old and 
      ten, were now gone to a strange religion; and so they through mine 
      hypocrisy, and desire to live a little time and a moment longer, should be 
      deceived by me, and I get a stain to mine old age, and make it abominable.  
      For though for the present time I should be delivered from the punishment 
      of men: yet should I not escape the hand of the Almighty, neither alive, 
      nor dead.  Wherefore now, manfully changing this life, I will shew 
      myself such an one as mine age requíreth, and leave a notable example to 
      such as be young to die willingly and courageously for the honourable and 
      holy laws. And when he had said these words, immediately he went to the

      of them that spake first said thus, What wouldest thou ask or learn of us? 
      we are ready to die, rather than to transgress the laws of our fathers.  
      Then the king, being in a rage, commanded pans and caldrons to be made 
      hot: which forthwith being heated, he commanded to cut out the tongue of 
      him that spake first, and to cut off the utmost parts of his body, the 
      rest of his brethren and his mother looking on.  Now when he was thus 
      maimed in all his members, he commanded him being yet alive to be brought 
      to the fire, and to be fried in the pan: and as the vapour of the pan was 
      for a good space dispersed, they exhorted one another with the mother to 
      die manfully.'];
