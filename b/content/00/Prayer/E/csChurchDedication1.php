O God, who dost invisibly embrace all things, and yet, for the salvation of mankind, dost visibly show forth the tokens of thy power; illumine this temple, we beseech thee, with the power of thy indwelling presence, and grant that all who come hither to pray, from whatsoever they may cry unto thee for deliverance, may obtain the blessings of thy consolation. Through our Lord.
