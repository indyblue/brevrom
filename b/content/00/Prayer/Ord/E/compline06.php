Almighty, everlasting God, who, by the co-operation of the Holy Ghost, didst prepare the body and soul of the glorious Virgin Mary worthily to become a suitable dwelling for thy Son; grant that, as we rejoice in her commemoration, we may, by her loving intercession, be delivered from present evils and from everlasting death. Through the same Christ our Lord.
