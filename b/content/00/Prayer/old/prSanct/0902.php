CONCÉDE, quæsumus, Ecclésiæ tuæ, omnípotens Deus: ut beátum Stéphanum Confessórem tuum, quem regnántem in terris propagatórem hábuit, propugnatórem habére mereátur gloriósum in cælis. Per Dóminum.
GRANT unto thy Church, we beseech thee, almighty God, that as she had a zealous champion in blessed Stephen whilst he reigned on earth, so she may deserve to have him as a protector now that he is glorious in heaven. Through our Lord.
