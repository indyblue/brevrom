O God, ever bountiful in forgiveness and lovingly desirous of manâ€™s salvation, we humbly beseech thy mercy ini behalf of the souls of all the faithful who have passed out of this world, that through the intercession of blessed Mary ever-Virgin, and of all the Saints, they may attain unto the fruition of eternal beatitude. Through Christ our Lord.
