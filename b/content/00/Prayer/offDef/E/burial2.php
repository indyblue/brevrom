O God, whose property it is ever to have mercy and to spare, we make humble supplication to thee on behalf of the soul of thy <sr>(</s>servant <sr>N. or</s> handmaid <sr>N.)</s>, which thou this day hast called out of this world: cast not that soul into the hands of the enemy, nor be forever forgetful of it; but bid thy holy Angels welcome it into heaven, its true fatherland. Ever hath it hoped in thee and believed in thee; doom it not to the flames of hell, but vouchsafe to it that happiness which hath no end. Through our Lord.
