Almighty and everlasting God, behold, I approach the Sacrament of thy only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ. I approach, as one sick, to the physician of life; as one unclean, to the fountain of mercy; as one blind, to the light of everlasting brightness; as one poor and needy, to the Lord of heaven and earth. Therefore I implore the abundance of thy measureless bounty, as far as thou mayest vouchsafe to heal my infirmity, to cleanse my filth, to enlighten my blindness, to clothe my nakedness, that I may receive the Bread of Angels, the King of kings and Lord of lords, with so much reverence and humility, so much contrition and devotion, so much purity and faith, such a purpose and intention, as is expedient to my soul’s salvation. Give me, I beseech thee, to receive, not the Sacrament only of the Lord’s Body and Blood, but also the substance and efficacy of the Sacrament. O most gracious God! give me so to receive the body of thy only begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ, which he drew from the Virgin Mary, that I may merit to be incorporated with his mystical body, and to be numbered among its members. O most loving Father! grant that I may at length perpetually contemplate, with face revealed, thy beloved Son, whom now I purpose to receive veiled on the way. Who liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. Amen.
