O God, who in thine ineffable foreknowledge didst choose blessed Joseph to be the husband of thine own most holy Mother; mercifully grant that now that he is in heaven with thee, we who on earth do reverence him for our defender, may worthily be holpen by the succour of his prayers to thee on our behalf; Who livest and reignest, world without end.
