O God, the pastor and governor of all the faithful, look down in Thy mercy on thy servant, <sr>N.</s> whom Thou hast appointed Pastor over Thy Church; and grant, we beseech Thee, that, both by word and example, he may edify all those that are under his charge, and, with the flock entrusted to him, arrive, at length, at eternal happiness. Through our Lord.
