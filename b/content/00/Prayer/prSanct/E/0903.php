O God, who to safeguard Catholic faith and to restore all things in Christ, didst fill the Supreme Pontiff, Saint Pius, with heavenly wisdom and apostolic fortitude: grant in thy mercy: that by striving to fulfil his ordinances and to follow his example, we may reap eternal rewards. Through the same.
