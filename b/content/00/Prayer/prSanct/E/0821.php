Almighty and merciful God, who, inflaming blessed Jane Frances with thy love, didst endow her with a marvellous fortitude of spirit to pursue the way of perfection in all the paths of life, and wast pleased through her to enrich thy Church with a new offspring; grant, by her merits and intercession, that we who, knowing our own weakness, trust in thy strength, may by the help of thy heavenly grace overcome all things that oppose us. Through our Lord.
