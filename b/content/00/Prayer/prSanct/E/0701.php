O almighty, eternal God, who hast ordained thine only-begotten Son to be the Redeemer of the world, and wast willing to be appeased by his blood; grant unto us, we beseech thee, so to venerate with solemn rite the price of our redemption, and to be on earth so defended by its power from the evils of this present life, that we may rejoice in its perpetual fruit in heaven. Through the same.
