O God, who didst will that the blessed and ever-Virgin Mary, herself the dwelling-place of the Holy Ghost, should this day be presented in the temple; grant, we beseech thee, that through her intercession we may be found worthy to be presented in the temple of thy glory. Through our Lord...in the unity of the same Holy Spirit.
