O God, who, in the glorious Transfiguration of thy only-begotten Son, hast confirmed the mysteries of the faith by the testimony of the Fathers, and who, in the voice that came from the bright cloud, didst in a wonderful manner foreshadow the adoption of sons; mercifully vouchsafe to make us co-heirs with the King of glory, and make us to be hereafter partakers of that same glory. Through the same.
