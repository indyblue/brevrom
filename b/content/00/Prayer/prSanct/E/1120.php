O God, who didst vouchsafe by a token from heaven to call blessed Felix thy Confessor out of the desert to the work of ransoming captives; grant, we beseech thee, that we, being by his intercession delivered through thy grace from the captivity of our sins, may be brought to our heavenly country. Through our Lord.
