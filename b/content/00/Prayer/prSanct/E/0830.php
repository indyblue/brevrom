O almighty God, the bountiful giver of all good gifts, who didst will that blessed Rose, being watered by the heavenly dew of thy prevenient grace, should bloom in the Indies, in the beauty of virginity and patience; grant unto us thy servants that, running after the odour of her sweetness, we may be found worthy to become a sweet savour of Christ. Who liveth.
