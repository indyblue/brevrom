Almighty everlasting God, who in the Heart of the blessed Virgin Mary didst prepare a dwelling worthy of the Holy Ghost: grant in thy mercy, that we who with devout minds celebrate the festival of that immacuate Heart, may be able to live according to thine own Heart. Through our Lord...in the unity of the same Holy Spirit.
