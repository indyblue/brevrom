Almighty and merciful God, who didst make St. John Mary wonderful in his pastoral zeal and constant prayer and penance: grant, we beseech thee, that by his example and intercession we may be able to win the souls of our brethren for Christ, and together with them attain to everlasting glory. Through the same.
