O God, who didst adorn blessed Robert thy Bishop and Doctor with wondrous learning and virtue that he might lay bare the snares of error and maintain the rights of the Apostolic See; grant by his merits and intercession that we may grow in love of the truth, and that the hearts of the wayward may return to the unity of thy Church. Through our Lord.
