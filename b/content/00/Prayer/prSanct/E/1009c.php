O God, who didst on this day strengthen with the virtue of constancy in suffering blessed Dionysius thy Martyr and Bishop, and didst vouchsafe to make Rusticus and Eleutherius his companions in preaching thy glory to the heathen; grant, we beseech thee, that, following their examples, we may learn, for the love of thee, to despise the prosperity of this world, and to fear none of its adversities. Through our Lord.
