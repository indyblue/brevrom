O God, who, for training the youth in the spirit of piety and understanding, didst by means of blessed Joseph thy Confessor vouchsafe to provide thy Church with a new help; grant, we beseech thee, that, by his example and intercession, we may so act and teach as to obtain an eternal reward. Through our Lord.
