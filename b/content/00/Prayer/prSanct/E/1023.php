O God, with the virtues of an apostle thou didst exalt blessed Anthony Mary, thy Confessor and Bishop, and through him build in thy Church new religious congregations of clerics and virgins: grant, we beseech thee, that led by his counsels and helped by his prayers, we may unremittingly work for the salvation of souls. Through our Lord.
