O God, who in blessed Jerome thy Confessor hast vouchsafed to provide thy Church a Doctor mighty in expounding holy Scripture; grant, we beseech thee, that, by his merits pleading for us, we may, by thy help, be enabled at the same time to practise whatsoever he taught both by word and work. Through our Lord.
