O God, who wert pleased that by means of blessed John thy faithful people should, through the power of the most holy name of Jesus, triumph over the enemies of the Cross; grant, we beseech thee, that, by his intercession, we may frustrate the wiles of our spiritual foes, and be counted worthy to receive from thee the crown of justice. Through our Lord.
