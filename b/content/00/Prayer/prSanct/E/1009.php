O God, who for the propagation of the faith among the nations wast pleased in a wondrous manner to raise up blessed John, thy Confessor, and through him didst in thy Church gather together a new family for the instruction of the faithful: grant to us thy servants, that we may so profit by his teaching, as to attain everlasting rewards. Through our Lord.
