O God, at whose Passion, according to the prophecy of Simeon, a sword of sorrow did pierce through the most sweet soul of the glorious Virgin and Mother Mary; mercifully grant that we, who devoutly celebrate her Transfixion and suffering, may, through the mediation of the glorious merits and prayers of all the Saints who faithfully stand beneath thy Cross, obtain the blessed fruit of thy Passion. Who livest.
