O almighty and eternal God, who, in thy wonderful ordinance, dost choose the weak things of the world to confound the strong; mercifully grant to our lowliness that, by the gracious prayers of blessed Didacus thy Confessor, we may deserve to be raised to the everlasting glory of heaven. Through our Lord.
