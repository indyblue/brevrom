O God, who didst confer upon blessed Laurence, thy Confessor and Doctor, a spirit of wisdom and fortitude in hard labours for the glory of thy name and for the salvation of souls: grant us in the same spirit both to perceive where our duty lies; and to accomplish it through his intercession. Through our Lord.
