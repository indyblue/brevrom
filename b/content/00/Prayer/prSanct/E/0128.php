O God, who didst divinely inspire blessed Peter, that, following the example of charity, he should enrich thy Church with a new offspring for the ransoming of the faithful; grant by his intercession that, set free from the thraldom of sin, we may enjoy never-ending liberty in our heavenly country. Who livest.
