O most merciful God, who, whilst the blessed Abbot Sylvester, gazing into an open sepulchre, meditated on the vanity of this world, didst vouchsafe to call him into the desert, and there to adorn him with the merits of a holy life; we thy suppliants beseech thee that, following his example and despising transitory things, we may enjoy eternal fellowship with thee. Through our Lord.
