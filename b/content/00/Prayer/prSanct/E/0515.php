O God, who, that the poor might receive a Christian education, and youth be strengthened in the way of truth, didst raise up the holy Confessor John Baptist, and through him didst form a new Society in thy Church; mercifully grant that, by his intercession, and following his example, we may for thy gloryâ€™s sake devote ourselves fervently to the salvation of souls, and thus attain unto a like reward. Through our Lord.
