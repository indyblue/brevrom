O God, who, for the deliverance of Christâ€™s faithful people from the hands of the infidels, wast pleased, through the most glorious Mother of thy Son, to enrich thy Church with a fresh progeny; grant, we beseech thee, that as we venerate in her the foundress of so great a work, so by her merits and intercession we may be delivered from all our sins, and from the bondage of the devil. Through the same.
