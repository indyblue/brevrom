O God, who didst teach blessed Hedwige to forsake with her whole heart the pomp of this world, that she might humbly follow thy Cross: grant that, through her example and merits, we may learn to trample under foot the perishable delights of this world, and, by clinging to thy Cross, to overcome all things that oppose us. Who livest.
