O God, who didst on this day translate blessed Henry thy Confessor from the height of an earthly empire to thy eternal kingdom; we humbly beseech thee that as, by the fullness of thy preventing grace, thou didst strengthen him to overcome the enticements of this life, so thou wouldst enable us to shun, by his example, the blandishments of the world, and with pure hearts to come unto thee. Through our Lord.
