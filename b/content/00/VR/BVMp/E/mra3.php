Receive, O Virgin Mary, the word which the Lord hath sent thee through an Angel: Thou shalt conceive and bring forth both God and man, * that thou mayest be called blessed amongst all women.
Yea, thou shalt bring forth a son, and shalt suffer no loss of virginity: thou shalt be with child, and shalt be a mother ever undefiled.
