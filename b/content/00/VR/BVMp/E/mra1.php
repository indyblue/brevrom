The Angel Gabriel was sent the Virgin Mary, espoused to Joseph, declaring unto her the word, and the Virgin trembles at the light. Fear not, Mary, thou hast found grace with the Lord: * behold, thou shalt conceive and bring forth, and he shall be called the Son of the most High.
The Lord shall give unto him the throne of David his father; and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever.
