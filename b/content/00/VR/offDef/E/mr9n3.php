Deliver me, O Lord, from eternal death, in that dreadful day: * when the heavens and the earth shall be moved, * when thou shalt come to judge the world by fire.
I tremble and do fear, when the examination is to be, and thy wrath to come.
That day is the day of anger, of calamity, and of misery, a great day, and very bitter.
