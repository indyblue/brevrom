Gaudent in cælis * ánimæ Sanctórum, qui Christi vestígia sunt secúti; et, quia pro ejus amóre sánguinem suum fudérunt, ídeo cum Christo exsúltant sine fine.
In heaven do rejoice * the souls of the Saints, who have followed the steps of Christ; and because they shed their blood for his love, therefore do they exult with Christ, world without end.
