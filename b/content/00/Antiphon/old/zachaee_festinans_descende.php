Zachæe, * festínans descénde, quia hódie in domo tua opórtet me manére. At ille festínans descéndit, et suscépit illum gaudens in domum suam. Hódie huic dómui salus a Deo facta est, allelúja.
Zacchaeus, * make haste and come down; for this day I must abide in thy house: and he made haste and came down, and received him with joy into his house. This day is salvation come from God to this house, alleluia.
