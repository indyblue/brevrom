Behold a high priest * who in his days pleased God, and was found righteous.

None was found * like unto him, to keep the law of the Most High.
Ideo jurejurándo * fecit illum Dóminus créscere in plebem suam.
Therefore by an oath * the Lord assured him that he would multiply his seed among his people.

Good and faithful servant, * enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.
