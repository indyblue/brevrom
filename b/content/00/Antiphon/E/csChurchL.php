Holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, * unto length of days.
My house * shall be called the house of prayer.
This is the house of the Lord, * strongly built, it is firmly founded upon the solid rock.
The house of the Lord * is well founded upon the solid rock.
All thy walls * are precious stones, and the towers of Jerusalem shall be built up with jewels.
