Behold a high priest * who in his days pleased God, and was found righteous.
None was found * like unto him, to keep the law of the Most High.
Therefore by an oath * the Lord assured him that he would multiply his seed among his people.
O all ye priests of God, * bless ye the Lord: O all ye servants of the Lord, sing praises unto our God <sr>(</s>alleluia<sr>)</s>.
Good and faithful servant, * enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.
