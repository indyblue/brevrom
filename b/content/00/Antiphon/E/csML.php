He that shall have confessed me * before men, him will I also confess before my Father.
He that followeth me * walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light of life, saith the Lord.
If any man minister unto me, * let him follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant be also.
Whosoever shall have ministered unto me, * my Father who is in heaven will honour him, saith the Lord.
Father, I will * that where I am, there also my servant may be.
