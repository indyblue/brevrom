While the king * was at his repose, my spikenard sent forth the odour of sweetness.
We will run after the odour * of thy ointments; young maidens have loved them exceedingly.
The winter is now past, * the rain is over and gone. Arise, my beloved, and come.
Come, my chosen one, * and I will establish my throne within thee <sr>(</s>alleluia<sr>)</s>.
She is beautiful * among the daughters of Jerusalem.
