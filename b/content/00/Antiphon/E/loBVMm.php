Blessed art thou * amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
Like the best myrrh, * thou hast yielded a sweet odour, O holy Mother of God.
Before this Virginâ€™s couch * sing for us again and again the sweet songs of the play.
In thy comeliness and thy beauty * set out, proceed prosperously, and reign.
God shall help her * with his countenance: God dwelleth in her, she shall not be moved.
As of people all rejoicing, * so is our dwelling in thee, O holy Mother of God.
Rejoice, O Virgin Mary, * alone thou hast destroyed all heresies throughout the world.
Vouchsafe that I * may praise thee, O holy Virgin; give me strength against thine enemies.
After child-bearing, * O Virgin, thou didst remain inviolate; Mother of God, intercede for us.
The Angel of the Lord * declared unto Mary, and she conceived by the Holy Spirit.
