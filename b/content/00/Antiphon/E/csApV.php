The Lord hath sworn, * and he will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever.
He will set him * with the princes of his people.
O Lord, thou hast broken * my bonds in sunder: I will offer unto thee the sacrifice of praise.
They went forth * on their way and wept, scattering their seed.
Their principality * is strengthened: and thy friends, O God, are greatly honoured.
