This is my commandment, * that you love one another, as I have loved you.
Greater love than this * no man hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
Ye are my friends, * if ye do the things that I command you, saith the Lord.
Blessed are the peacemakers, * blessed are the clean of heart; for they shall see God.
In your patience * ye shall possess your souls.
