This is a wise virgin, * and one of the number of the prudent.
This is a wise virgin, * whom the Lord found watching.
This is she that knew not * the bed of dishonour; she shall have her fruit in the esteem of holy souls.
Come, my chosen one, * and I will establish my throne within thee <sr>(</s>alleluia<sr>)</s>.
She is beautiful * among the daughters of Jerusalem.
