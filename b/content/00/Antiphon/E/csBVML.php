While the king * was at his repose, my spikenard sent forth the odour of sweetness.
His left hand * is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.
I am black * but beautiful, O ye daughters of Jerusalem; therefore the King loved me, and brought me into his chamber.
For winter is now past, * the rain is over and gone; arise, my beloved, and come.
Thou art beautiful * and sweet in thy delights, O holy Mother of God.
