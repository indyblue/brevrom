Lord, thou gavest me five talents; * behold I have gained another five over and above.
Well done, good servant, * faithful in little things, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.
A faithful servant * and wise, whom the Lord hath set over his household.
Blessed is that servant, * whom, when the Lord shall come and knock at the gate, he shall find watching.
Good servant * and faithful, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.
