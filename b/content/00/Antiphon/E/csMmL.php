All the Saints, * how many the torments they have suffered, that they might securely attain the palm of martyrdom!
With their palms * the Saints have entered into their kingdom, and have earned crowns of beauty from the hand of God.
The bodies of the Saints * are buried in peace, and their names shall live for evermore.
O ye Martyrs of the Lord, * bless ye the Lord for ever and ever.
O choir of Martyrs, * praise ye the Lord from the heavens, <sr>(</s>alleluia<sr>)</s>.
