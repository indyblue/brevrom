Deal favourably, O Lord, * in thy good will, with Sion.
The Lord our God * is righteous: and there is no iniquity in him.
From the fear of the enemy * deliver, O Lord, my soul.
The Lord will have mercy * on his servants: and he will be merciful to the land of his people.
Praise ye * the Lord, according to the multitude of his greatness.
