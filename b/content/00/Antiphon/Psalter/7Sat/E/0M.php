He hath remembered his covenant * for ever, the Lord our God.
The Lord increased * his people exceedingly: and strengthened them over their enemies.
God brought forth * his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness.
The Lord saved them * for his own nameâ€™s sake.
They forgot God, * who saved them.
When they were in tribulation, * the Lord saw: and he heard their prayer.
Then they cried to the Lord: * and he delivered them out of their distresses.
These have seen * the works of God, and his wonders in the deep.
The just shall see, * and shall rejoice, and will understand the mercies of the Lord.
