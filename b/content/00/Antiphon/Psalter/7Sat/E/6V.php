Blessed be the Lord, * my support and my deliverer.
Happy is that people * whose God is the Lord.
Great is the Lord, * and greatly to be praised: and of his greatness there is no end.
The Lord is sweet * to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.
The Lord is faithful * in all his words: and holy in all his works.â€¡
