Blot out my iniquity, O Lord, * according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
Distinguish my cause, * O God, from the nation that is not holy.
May God have mercy * on us and bless us.â€¡
Thou shalt correct me, O Lord, * and make me to live.
Praise * the Lord, for he is kind, and will be entreated in favour of his servants.
