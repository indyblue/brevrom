To thee only have I sinned, * O Lord: have mercy on me.
Return, O Lord, * and be entreated in favour of thy servants.
Thou hast multiplied, O God, * thy mercy.
The Lord is my strength * and my praise, and he is become salvation to me.
Praise ye * the Lord, who healeth the broken of heart, and bindeth up their bruises.
