Behold, how good * and how pleasant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity.â€¡
Praise the Lord, * for his mercy endureth forever.
Praise the Lord, * who was mindful of us in our affliction
Let my tongue cleave * to my jaws, if do not I remember thee, O Jerusalem.
I will praise * thy name, O Lord, for thy mercy and for thy truth.
