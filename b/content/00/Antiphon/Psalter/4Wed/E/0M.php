Thou art beautiful * above the sons of men, grace is poured abroad in thy lips.
People shall praise thee, * O God, for ever.
A helper in troubles, * O our God.
Great is the Lord, * and exceedingly to be praised in the city of our God.‡
My mouth shall speak * wisdom: and the meditation of my heart understanding. 
Be not thou afraid: * he that hath riches shall not descend in the grave with his glory.
The God of gods, * the Lord hath spoken.‡
Understand, * you that forget God.
Thou shalt accept the sacrifice * of justice upon thy altar, O Lord.
