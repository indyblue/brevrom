Wash me yet more, * O Lord, from my iniquity.
Thou wilt pardon * our transgressions, O God.
In the innocence * of my heart I will walk, O Lord.
My heart hath rejoiced * in the Lord, who humbleth and exalteth.
Praise, * O my soul, the Lord, who setteth up all that are cast down, and loveth the just.
