The Lord said * to my Lord: Sit thou at my right hand.â€¡
Great are the works of the Lord, * sought out according to all his wills.
The man that feareth the Lord * shall desire exceedingly his commandments.
Blessed be the name * of the Lord forever.
But our God * is in heaven; he hath done all things whatsoever he would.
