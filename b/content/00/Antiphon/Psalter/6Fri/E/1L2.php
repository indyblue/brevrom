A contrite * and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
For thy nameâ€™s sake, * O Lord, thou wilt quicken me in thy justice.
Thou wilt turn, O God, * and bring us to life; and thy people shall rejoice in thee.
When thou art angry, * O Lord, thou wilt remember mercy.
Praise * thy God, O Sion, who declareth his judgments to Israel.
