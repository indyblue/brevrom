Exalt ye * the Lord our God, and adore at his holy mountain.
Deliver me * from my enemies. O Lord, to thee have I fled.
Thou hast blessed, * O Lord, thy land: thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people.
In the Lord shall all the seed * of Israel be justified and praised.
Praise * the Lord, O Jerusalem.â€¡
