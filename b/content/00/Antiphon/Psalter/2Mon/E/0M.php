The Lord from heaven * hath looked down upon the children of men.
He that worketh justice, * shall rest in thy holy hill, O Lord.
Incline thy ear unto me, O Lord, * and hear my words.
I will love thee, * O Lord, my strength.
The Lord will reward me, * according to my justice.
The Lord liveth, * and blessed be the God of my salvation.
May the Lord hear thee * in the day of tribulation.‡
In thy strength, * O Lord, the king shall joy.‡
I will extol thee, * O Lord, for thou hast upheld me.‡
