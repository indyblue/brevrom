Quæ est ista, * speciósa sicut colúmba, quasi rosa plantáta super rivos aquárum?
Who is this, * beautiful as a dove, like a rose planted by the brooks of water?
Virgo potens, * sicut turris David: mille clýpei pendent ex ea, omnis armatúra fórtium.
It is the mighty Virgin, * like the tower of David; a thousand bucklers hang upon it, all the armour of valiant men.
Ave, María, * grátia plena; Dóminus tecum: benedícta tu in muliéribus.
Hail Mary, * full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women.
Benedíxit te Dóminus * in virtúte sua, quia per te ad níhilum redégit inimícos nostros.
The Lord hath blessed * thee by his power, because by thee he hath brought our enemies to nought.
Vidérunt eam * fíliæ Sion vernántem in flóribus rosárum, et beatíssimam prædicavérunt.
The daughters of Sion * saw her adorned with the flowers of roses, and declared her most blessed.
