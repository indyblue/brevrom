Dabit illi * Dóminus Deus sedem David, patris ejus: et regnábit in domo Jacob in ætérnum, et regni ejus non erit finis, allelúja.
The Lord God * shall give unto him the throne of David, his father: and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end, alleluia.
