Who is this * that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bosra, this beautiful one in his robe?
I * that speak justice and am a defender to save.
He was clothed * in a robe sprinkled with blood, and his name is called the Word of God.
Why then * is thy apparel red, and thy garments like to them that tread the winepress?
I have trodden * the winepress alone, and of the gentiles there is not a man with me.
