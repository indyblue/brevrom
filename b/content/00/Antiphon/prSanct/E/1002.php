God hath given * his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
Let us bless the Lord * whom the Angels praise, unto whom the Cherubim and Seraphim cry: Holy, Holy, Holy.
Their Angels * always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
Blessed be God, * who sent his Angel, and delivered his servants who trusted in him.
Praise ye God, * all his Angels; praise ye him, all his hosts!
