These that are clothed * in white robes, who are they? and whence came they?
These are they * who are come out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb.
Therefore are they * before the throne of God, and they serve him day and night.
They have conquered * the dragon by the blood of the Lamb and the testament of his Word.
Blessed * are they who wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb.
