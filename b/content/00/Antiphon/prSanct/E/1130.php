Hail, precious Cross! * receive a disciple of him who hung on thee, my master, Christ.
Blessed Andrew * prayed, saying: O Lord, King of eternal glory, receive me hanging upon the cross.
Andrew, the servant of Christ, * a worthy Apostle of God, brother of Peter, and his companion in suffering.
Maximilla, beloved of Christ, * carried away the body of the Apostle, and buried it with sweet spices in an honourable place.
Thou, O Lord, * hast plunged into hell those who persecuted the just man; on the wood of the cross thou wast his leader.
