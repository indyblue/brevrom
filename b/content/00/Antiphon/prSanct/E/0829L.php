Herod apprehended * and bound John, and put him in prison because of Herodias.
O my lord king, * I will that forthwith thou give me in a dish the head of John the Baptist.
The mother commanded * the dancing-girl: Ask for nothing but the head of John.
John reproved * Herod on account of Herodias, whom he had taken for wife from his brother Philip.
Give me in a dish * the head of John the Baptist: and the king was struck sad because of his oath.
