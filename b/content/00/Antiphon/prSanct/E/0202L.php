Simeon, a just * and God-fearing man, waited for the redemption of Israel, and the Holy Ghost was in him.
Simeon received an answer * from the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death until he had seen the Lord.
Simeon, taking * the Child in his arms, giving thanks, blessed the Lord.
A light to the revelation of the Gentiles, * and the glory of thy people Israel.
They offered * for him to the Lord a pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.
