Who is this, * beautiful as a dove, like a rose planted by the brooks of water?
It is the mighty Virgin, * like the tower of David; a thousand bucklers hang upon it, all the armour of valiant men.
Hail Mary, * full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women.
The Lord hath blessed * thee by his power, because by thee he hath brought our enemies to nought.
The daughters of Sion * saw her adorned with the flowers of roses, and declared her most blessed.
