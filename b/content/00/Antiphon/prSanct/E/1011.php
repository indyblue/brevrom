Blessed art thou, * O Virgin Mary, who didst bear the Creator of all things.
Thou didst bring him forth * who made thee, and remainest a Virgin for ever.
When I was a little one, * I pleased the Most High, and from my womb I have brought forth God and man.
Daughter, thou art blessed * of the Lord: for by thee we have partaken of the fruit of life.
The daughters of Sion, * saw her, and called her blessed; and the queens praised her.
