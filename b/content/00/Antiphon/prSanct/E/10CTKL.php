The God of heaven * will set up a kingdom that shall break in pieces and shall consume all these kingdoms, and itself shall stand for ever.
The Lord gave him * power and glory, and a kingdom; and all peoples, tribes and tongues shall serve him.
Living waters shall go out * from Jerusalem; and the Lord shall be king over all the earth.
Now shall he be magnified * even to the ends of the earth, and this man shall be our peace.
The nation and the kingdom * that will not serve thee, shall perish: and the Gentiles shall be wasted with desolation.
