While St. Clement prayed, * there appeared unto him the Lamb of God.
Not for my own merits * hath the Lord sent me unto you, that I may share your crowns.
I saw on the mountain * the Lamb standing, from beneath whose foot flowed a fountain of living waters.
From beneath whose foot * a fountain of living waters flowed forth: the stream of the river that maketh glad the city of God.
All the nations * round about believed in Christ the Lord.
