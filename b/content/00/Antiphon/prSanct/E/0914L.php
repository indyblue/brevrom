O great work of love! * death then died, when life died on the tree.
Save us, * O Saviour Christ, by the power of the Cross; thou who didst save Peter in the sea, have mercy on us.
Behold the Cross of the Lord! * Flee, O ye his enemies, for the lion of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, hath conquered, alleluia.
But us it behoveth to glory * in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
By the sign of the Cross * deliver us from our enemies, O thou our God.
