The disciples said * to blessed Martin: Why, father, dost thou abandon us? Or to whom dost thou leave us in our desolation? For ravening wolves will rush upon thy flock.
Lord, * if I am still necessary to thy people, I do not refuse the labour: may thy will be done.
O man beyond all praise! * Neither conquered by labour, nor to be conquered by death; who neither feared to die, or refused to live.
Ever intent, with eyes and hands * raised to heaven, he never let his mighty spirit slacken in prayer, alleluia.
Martin * all-joyful is received into Abrahamâ€™s bosom: Martin, here poor and humble, enters heaven rich, and is honoured with celestial hymns.
