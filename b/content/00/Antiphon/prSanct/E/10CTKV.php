He shall be called * Peaceable, and his throne shall be most firm for ever.
His kingdom * is an everlasting kingdom, and all kings shall serve him, and shall obey him.
Behold a man, the Orient * is his name: he shall sit and rule, and shall speak peace to the Gentiles.
The Lord * is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver: the Lord is our king, he will save us.
Behold, I have given thee * to be the light of the Gentiles, that thou mayst be my salvation even to the farthest part of the earth.
