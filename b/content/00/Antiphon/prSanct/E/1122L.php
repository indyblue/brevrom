While the musical instruments were playing, * Cecilia sang unto the Lord, saying: Let my heart be undefiled, that I be not confounded.
Valerian * found Cecilia praying in her chamber, and with her an angel.
Cecilia * thy handmaid serves thee, O Lord, as a busy bee.
I bless thee, * O Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, for through thy Son the fire was quenched at my side.
I asked * of the Lord three days, that I might consecrate my house as a church.
