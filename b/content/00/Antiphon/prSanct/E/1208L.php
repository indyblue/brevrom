Thou art all fair, * O Mary, and the stain of original sin is not in thee.
Thy garment * is white as snow, and thy face is as the sun.
Thou art the glory of Jerusalem, * thou art the joy of Israel, thou art the honour of our people.
Blessed art thou, * O Virgin Mary, by the Lord the most high God, above all women upon the earth.
Draw us, * O immaculate Virgin, we will run after thee, in the odour of thy ointments.
