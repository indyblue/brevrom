Whither is * thy beloved gone, o thou most beautiful among women? Whither is thy beloved turned aside, and we will seek him with thee?
Depart from me, * I will weep bitterly; labour not to comfort me.
There is no beauty * in him, nor comeliness: and we have seen him, and there was no sightliness.
From the sole of the foot * unto the top of the head, there is no soundness in him.
Stay me up with flowers, * compass me about with apples, because I languish with love.
