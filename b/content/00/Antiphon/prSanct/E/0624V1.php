He shall go * before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to prepare unto the Lord a perfect people.
John * is his name; he shall drink no wine nor strong drink, and many shall rejoice at his birth.
From an aged and barren womb * was born John, the forerunner of the Lord.
This child shall be * great before the Lord: for his hand is with him.
This child * shall be called a Nazarite: he shall not drink wine nor strong drink, and from his motherâ€™s womb he shall eat nothing unclean.
