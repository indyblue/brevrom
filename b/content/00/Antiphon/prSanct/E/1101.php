I saw a great multitude, * which no man could number, of all nations, standing before the throne.
And all the Angels * stood round about the throne, and they fell down before the throne upon their faces, and adored God.
O Lord God, * thou hast redeemed us in thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, and hast made us a kingdom to our God.
Bless ye the Lord, * all his elect, keep his days of joy, and give glory to him.
A hymn * to all his Saints; to the children of Israel, a people approaching to him: this glory is to all his Saints.
