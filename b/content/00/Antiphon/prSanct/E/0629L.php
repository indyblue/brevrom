Peter and John * went up to the temple at the ninth hour of prayer.
Silver and gold * I have none; but what I have, I give unto thee.
The Angel said to Peter: * cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.
The Lord hath sent * his Angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, alleluia.
Thou art Peter, * and upon this rock I will build my Church.
