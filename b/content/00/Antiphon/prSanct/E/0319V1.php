But Jacob * begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
The Angel Gabriel * was sent from God to a Virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David, and the Virginâ€™s name was Mary.
When Mary, * the Mother of Jesus, was espoused to Joseph, they had not come together when she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
Joseph, her husband, * being a just man, and not willing to expose her to shame, was minded to put her away privately.
The Angel of the Lord * appeared unto Joseph, saying: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary, thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost, and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus.
