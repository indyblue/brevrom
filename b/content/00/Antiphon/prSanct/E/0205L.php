Who art thou * that comest unto me to heal my wounds? I am the Apostle of Christ, have no suspicion of me, my daughter.
I have never applied * a medicine of this earth to my body, but I have my Lord Jesus Christ, who by his word alone restoreth all things.
I give thee thanks, * O Lord Jesus Christ, because thou art mindful of me, and hast sent thine Apostle unto me to heal my wounds.
I bless thee, * O Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, because by thine Apostle thou hast restored my breast to my bosom.
He that hath vouchsafed * to heal all my wounds and to restore my breast to my bosom, upon him do I call, the living God.
