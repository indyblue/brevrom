Elizabeth, Zacharyâ€™s wife, * hath brought forth a great man, John the Baptist, precursor of the Lord.
They made signs to his father, * how he would have him called: and he wrote saying: John is his name.
His name * shall be called John: and many shall rejoice in his nativity.
Among them that are born of women, * there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist.
Thou, child, * shall be called the Prophet of the Most High: thou shalt go before the Lord to prepare his ways.
