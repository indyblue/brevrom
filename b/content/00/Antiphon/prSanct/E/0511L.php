Lord, * show us the Father, and it sufficeth us, alleluia.
Philip, * he that seeth me, seeth my Father also, alleluia.
Have I been so long a time * with you, and you have not known me? Philip, he who seeth me, seeth my Father also, alleluia.
If you had known me, * you would without doubt have known my Father also, and from henceforth you shall know him, and you have seen him, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
If you love me, * keep my commandments, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
