The Angel Gabriel * was sent to Mary, a Virgin espoused to Joseph.
Hail, Mary, * full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
Fear not, Mary, * thou hast found grace with the Lord; behold thou shalt conceive, and shalt bring forth a son.
And the Lord shall give unto him * the throne of David, his father, and he shall reign for ever.
Behold the handmaid of the Lord: * be it done to me according to thy word.
