Have mercy * on me, O God, and cleanse me from my sin, for against thee only have I sinned.
I will praise * thee, for thou hast heard me.
O God, my God, * to thee do I watch at break of day, for thou art become my helper.
Blessed art thou * in the firmament of heaven, and worthy to be praised for ever, O our God.
Praise ye * the Lord from the heavens.â€¡
