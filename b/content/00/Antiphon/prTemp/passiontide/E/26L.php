God spared not * his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.
My spirit is in anguish * within me, my heart within me is troubled.
The thief said to the thief: * We, indeed, receive the due reward of our deeds; but what has this man done? Remember me, O Lord, when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.
When my soul shall be * in trouble, O Lord, thou wilt be mindful of thy mercy.
Remember me, * O Lord, when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.
