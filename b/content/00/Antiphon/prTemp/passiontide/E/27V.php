Today I am greatly afflicted, but tomorrow I will break my bonds.
With them * that hated peace I was peaceable: when I spoke to them they fought against me without cause.
From unjust men * deliver me, O Lord.
Keep me * from the snare, which they have laid for me, and from the stumbling-blocks of them that work iniquity.
I looked * on my right hand, and beheld, and there was no one that would know me.
