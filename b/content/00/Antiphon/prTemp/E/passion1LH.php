Deliver me, O Lord, * and set me beside thee, and let any manâ€™s hand fight against me.
Thou hast judged, O Lord, * the cause of my soul, thou the Redeemer of my life.
O my people, * what have I done to thee? or in what have I molested thee? Answer thou me.

Shall evil be rendered * for good, because they have dug a pit for my soul?
