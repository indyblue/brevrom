Behold, the Lord shall come, * the Prince of the kings of the earth: blessed are they who are prepared to meet him.
When the Son of man * shall come, thinkest thou he will find faith upon the earth?
Behold, now is come * the fulness of time, in which God sent his own Son on the earth.
Ye shall draw waters * with joy out of the Saviourâ€™s fountains.
The Lord * shall go forth from his holy place: he shall come to save his people.
