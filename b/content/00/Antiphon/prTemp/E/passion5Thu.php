Thou shalt be justified, O Lord, * in thy words, and shalt overcome when thou art judged.
The Lord * was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and he opened not his mouth.
My heart * is broken within me, and all my bones trembled.
Thou hast exhorted us * by thy strength, and in thy holy banquet, O Lord.
He was offered up * because he willed it, and he hath borne our sins.
