As I live, * saith the Lord: I will not the death of a sinner, but that he be converted and live.
There are come to us * days of penance, to redeem our sins and to save our souls.
Let us prove ourselves * in much patience, in much fasting, by the armour of justice.

By the armour of justice * of the power of God, let us exhibit ourselves in much patience.
