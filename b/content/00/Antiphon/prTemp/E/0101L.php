O admirable interchange! * The Creator of the human race, assuming a living body, deigns to be born of a Virgin: and becoming man, from no human generation, hath bestowed upon us his divinity.
When thou wast born * ineffably of the Virgin, the Scriptures were fulfilled: thou camest down as rain into the fleece, to save the children of men. We praise thee, O our God.
In the bush seen by Moses * as burning yet unconsumed, we recognise the preservation of thy glorious virginity. O Mother of God, intercede for us.
The root of Jesse hath budded; * the star hath risen out of Jacob; a Virgin hath brought forth the Saviour. We praise thee, O our God.
Behold, Mary hath brought forth * unto us the Saviour, whom, when John saw, he cried out: Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Alleluia.
