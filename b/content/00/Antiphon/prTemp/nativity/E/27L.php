Most worthy of honour is * blessed John, who leaned upon the Lordâ€™s breast at the Supper.
This is that disciple * who giveth testimony of these things, and we know that his testimony is true.
This is my disciple: * so I will have him remain till I come.
There are some that stand here * who shall not taste death until they see the Son of Man in his kingdom.
Behold my servant, * mine elect, whom I have chosen; I have put my spirit upon him.
