Whosoever * shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Holy and terrible * is his name: the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
Yet will I * will rejoice in the Lord; I will joy in God my Jesus.
From the rising of the sun * to the going down of the same, the name of the Lord is worthy of praise.
I will sacrifice * a sacrifice of praise, and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
