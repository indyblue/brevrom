Whom have ye seen, * O Shepherds? Say, tell us, who is it has appeared on the earth?—We have seen the Child that is born, and choirs of Angels praising the Lord, alleluia, alleluia.
The Mother has given birth * to the King, whose name is eternal: she has both a Mother’s joy and a Virgin’s privilege: not one has ever been, or shall ever be, like her, alleluia.
The Angel said unto the Shepherds: * I bring you tidings of great joy; for this day is born unto you the Saviour of the world, alleluia.
With the Angel * was a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying: Glory to God in the highest; and on earth, peace to men of good will, alleluia.
A Little Child * is this day born unto us, and he shall be called God, the Mighty One, alleluia, alleluia.
