The King of Peace, * whom the whole earth desireth to see, hath shown his greatness.
The King of peace * is magnified above all the kings of the earth.
The days were completed * for Mary that she should bring forth her first-born son.
Know ye * that the kingdom of God is at hand: amen, I say unto you, it shall not tarry.
Raise up your heads: * lo! your redemption is at hand.
