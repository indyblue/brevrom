The prophets foretold * that a Saviour would be born of the Virgin Mary.
The Spirit * of the Lord is upon me, he hath sent me to bring glad tidings to the poor.
For Sionâ€™s sake * I will not hold my peace, till her Just One come forth as brightness.
Behold, the Lord shall come, * that he may sit among the princes, and inherit the throne of his glory.
Declare * to the people, and say: Behold, God our Saviour shall come.
