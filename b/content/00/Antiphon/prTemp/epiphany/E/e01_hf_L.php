After three days, * they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them, and asking them questions.
The mother of Jesus said * to him: Son, why hast thou done so to us? Behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
Jesus went down * with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them.
And Jesus advanced * in wisdom, and age, and grace with God and men.
And they said: * How came this man by this wisdom and miracles? Is not this the carpenterâ€™s son?
> Lk 2:46-52, Mt 13:54-55
