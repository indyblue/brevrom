Ye mountains of Gelboe, * let neither dew nor rain come upon you: for there was cast away the shield of the valiant, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. How are the valiant fallen in battle? Jonathan is slain in the high places: Saul and Jonathan, lovely and comely in their life, even in death they were not divided.
