A priest for ever, * Christ the Lord, according to the order of Melchisedech, offered bread and wine.
The merciful Lord * hath given food unto them that fear him, as a memorial of his wonderful works.
I will take * the chalice of salvation: and I will sacrifice the victim of praise.
As young olive plants, * may the children of the Church be around the Lordâ€™s table.
The Lord, who putteth peace * on the borders of the Church, filleth us with the fat of wheat.
