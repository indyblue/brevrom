Then whilt thou accept * a sacrifice of justice, if thou shalt have turned away thy face from my sins.
It is better * to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in princes.
Thy right hand * hath upheld me, O Lord.
O Lord, thou art powerful * to deliver us from the strong hand: deliver us, O our God.
O ye kings of the earth, * and all people, praise God.
