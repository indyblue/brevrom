And the Angel of the Lord * descended from heaven, and going to the stone, rolled it back and sat upon it, alleluia, alleluia.
And behold! there was a great earthquake: * for an Angel of the Lord came down from heaven, alleluia.
And his countenance * was as lightning, and his raiment was as snow, alleluia, alleluia.
And for fear of him * the guards were terrified, and became as men struck dead, alleluia.
And the Angel answering, * said to the women: Fear not: for I know that ye seek Jesus, alleluia.
