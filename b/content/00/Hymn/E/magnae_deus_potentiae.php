Rev. W.J.Courthope


O Sovereign Lord of Nature’s might,
Who bad’st the water’s birth divide;
Part in the heavens to take their flight,
And part in ocean’s deep to hide;

These low obscured, on airy wing
Exalted those, that either race,
Though from one element they spring,
Might serve Thee in a different place.

Grant, Lord, that we Thy servants all,
Saved by Thy tide of cleansing Blood,
No more ’neath sin’s dominion fall,
Nor fear the thought of death’s dark flood!

Thy varied love each spirit bless,
The humble cheer, the high control;
Check in each heart its proud excess,
But raise the meek and contrite soul!

This boon, O Father, we entreat,
This blessing grant, Eternal Son,
And Holy Ghost, the Paraclete,
Both now, and while the ages run. Amen.
