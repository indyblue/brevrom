To thee, O Prince of all that be,
Thou Christ, O King eternally;
O Framer of the mind and heart,
Our one true Judge we say thou art.

The wicked protest, wail and cry,
Christ Jesus’ reign they would deny;
Rejoice we at thy glorious name,
Thou Highest King we do proclaim.

O Christ! The Source of all our peace,
Make all our sinful thoughts to cease;
And still in us our loves misplaced,
As Thy one sheepfold be we embraced.

For this, hanging on cruel tree,
With arms outstretched, for all to see;
His heart is pierced by soldier’s spear,
Revealing burning love most dear.

From this the altar of the tree
Thy blood flows forth from Calvary;
As wine to us it doth appear,
To thine own heart it draws us near.

Thou Governor of all that be,
May all thy creatures honour thee;
All those who rule, O Lord renew!
Source of all precepts just and true.

To regal glory, all submit,
All crowns and honours we do remit;—
To thy scepter—so sweet and mild!
Submit we as a little child.

All glory be, Jesu, to thee,
Thy scepter over all that be;
All glory, as is ever meet,
To Father and to Paraclete. Amen.
