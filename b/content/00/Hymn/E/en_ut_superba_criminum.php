Fr. E.Caswall


Lo! how the savage crew
Of our proud sins hath rent
The Heart of our all-gracious God,
That Heart so innocent.

The soldier’s quivering lance
Our guilt it was that drave,
Our wicked deeds that to its point
Such cruel sharpness gave.

O wounded Heart! whence sprang
The Church, the Saviour’s Bride;
Thou Door of our Salvation’s Ark
Set in its mystic side.

Thou holy Fount! whence flows
The sacred sevenfold flood.
Where we our filthy roles may cleanse
In the Lamb’s saving Blood:

By sorrowful relapse,
Thee will we rend no more;
But like the flames, those types of love,
Strive Heavenward to soar.

Father and Son supreme!
And Spirit! hear our cry;
Whose is the kingdom, praise, and power,
Through all eternity. Amen.
