Rev. W.J.Courthope


See the golden sun arise!
Let no more our darkened eyes
Snare us, tangled by surprise
In the maze of sin!

From false words and thoughts impure
Let this Light, serene and sure,
Keep our lips without secure,
Keep our souls within.

So may we the daytime spend,
That, till lifeâ€™s temptations end,
Tongue, nor hand, nor eye offend!
One, above us all,

Views in His revealing ray
All we do, and think, and say,
Watching us from break of day
Till the twilight fall.

Unto God the Father, Son,
Holy Spirit, Three in One,
One in Three, be glory done,
Now and evermore. Amen.
