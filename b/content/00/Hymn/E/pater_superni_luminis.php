Father of lights! one glance of Thine,
Whose eyes the Universe control,
Fills Magdalene with holy love,
And melts the ice within her soul.

Her precious ointment forth she brings,
Upon those sacred feet to pour;
She washes them with burning tears;
And with her hair she wipes them o’er.

Impassion’d to the Cross she clings;
Nor fears beside the tomb to stay;
Nought of its ruffian guard she recks,
For love has cast all fear away.

O Christ, thou very Love itself!
Blest home of man, through Thee forgiven!
So touch our spirits from above,
So purify our souls for Heaven.

To God the Father with the Son
And Holy Paraclete, with thee,
As evermore hath been before,
Be glory through eternity. Amen.
