Fr. E.Caswall


O bounteous Framer of the globe!
Who with thy mighty hand
Didst gather up the rolling seas,
And firmly base the land:

That so the freshly teeming earth
Might herb and seedling bear
All in their early beauty gay
With flowers and fruitage fair:

On our parchâ€™d souls pour Thou, O Lord,
The freshness of thy grace;
So penitence shall spring anew,
And all the past efface.

Grant us to fear thy holy law,
To feel thy goodness nigh;
Grant us through life thy peace; in death
Thine immortality.

Father of mercies! hear our cry;
Hear us, coequal Son!
Who reignest with the Holy Ghost
While endless ages run. Amen.
