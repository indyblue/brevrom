O Jesu! Thou the beauty art
Of angel worlds above;
Thy Name is music to the heart,
Enchanting it with love.

Celestial sweetness unalloy’d!
Who eat Thee hunger still;
Who drink of Thee still feel a void,
Which nought but Thou can fill.

O my sweet Jesu! hear the sighs
Which unto Thee I send;
To Thee mine inmost spirit cries,
My being’s hope and end!

Stay with us, Lord, and with thy light
Illume the soul’s abyss;
Scatter the darkness of our night,
And fill the world with bliss.

O Jesu! spotless Virgin flower!
Our life and joy! to Thee
Be praise, beatitude, and power,
Through all eternity. Amen.
