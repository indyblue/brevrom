Dear Maker of the starry skies!
Light of believers evermore!
Jesu, Redeemer of mankind!
Be near us who thine aid implore.

When man was sunk in sin and death,
Lost in the depth of Satanâ€™s snare,
Love brought Thee down to cure our ills,
By taking of those ills a share.

Thou, for the sake of guilty men
Permitting thy pure blood to flow,
Didst issue from thy Virgin shrine
And to the Cross a Victim go.

So great the glory of thy might,
If we but chance thy name to sound,
At once all Heaven and Hell unite
In bending low with awe profound.

Great Judge of all! in that last day,
When friends shall fail, and foes combine,
Be present then with us, we pray,
To guard us with thy arm divine.

To God the Father, with the Son,
And Holy Spirit, One and Three,
Be honour, glory, blessing, praise,
All through the long eternity. Amen.
