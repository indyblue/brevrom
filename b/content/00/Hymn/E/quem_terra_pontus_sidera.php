The Lord, whom earth, and air, and sea,
With one adoring voice resound;
Who rules them all in majesty;
In Mary’s heart a cloister found.

Lo! in a humble Virgin’s womb,
O’ershadowed by Almighty power;
He whom the stars, and sun, and moon,
Each serve in their appointed hour.

O Mother Blest! to whom was given
Within thy compass to contain
The Architect of earth and Heaven,
Whose hands the universe sustain:

To thee was sent an Angel down;
In thee the Spirit was enshrined;
From thee came forth that Mighty One,
The long-desired of all mankind.

O Jesu! born of Virgin bright,
Immortal glory be to Thee;
Praise to the Father infinite,
And Holy Ghost eternally. Amen.
