Fr. E.Caswall


Again the slowly circling year
Brings round the blessed hour,
When on the Saints the Paraclete
Came down in grace and power.

In fashion of a fiery tongue
On each and all He came;
Their lips with eloquence He strung,
And fill’d their hearts with flame.

Straightway with divers tongues they speak,
Instinct with grace divine;
While wond’ring crowds the cause mistake,
And deem them drunk with wine.

These things were mystically wrought,
The Paschal time complete,
When Israel’s Law remission brought
Of every legal debt.

God of all grace! to Thee we pray,
To Thee adoring bend;
Into our hearts this sacred day
Thy Spirit’s fulness send.

Thou, who in ages past didst pour
Thy graces from above,
Thy grace in us where lost restore,
And stablish peace and love.

All glory to the Father be;
And to the Son who rose;
Glory, O Holy Ghost! to Thee,
While age on ages flows. Amen.
