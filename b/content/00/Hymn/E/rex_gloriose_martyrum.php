R.Littledale, G.Palmer


O glorious King of martyr hosts,
Thou crown that each confessor boasts,
Who leadest to celestial day
The saints who cast earthâ€™s joys away.

Thine ear in mercy, Savior, lend,
While unto thee our prayers ascend;
And as we count their triumphs won,
Forgive the sins that we have done.

Martyrs in thee their triumphs gain,
Confessors grace from thee obtain;
We sinners humbly seek to thee,
From sins offense to set us free.

All laud to God the Father be,
All praise, eternal Son, to thee;
All glory, as is ever meet,
To God the holy Paraclete. Amen.
