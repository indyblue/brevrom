God, in whom all grace doth dwell!
Grant us grace to ponder well
On the Virgin’s Dolours seven;
On the wounds to Jesus given.

May the tears which Mary pour’d
Gain us pardon of the Lord;—
Tears excelling in their worth
All the penances of earth.

May the contemplation sore
Of the five wounds Jesus bore,
Source to us of blessings be,
Through a long eternity.

To the Incarnate Son who died
For his servants crucified,
Praise be rendered, with the Sire
And the Spirit Sanctifier. Amen.
