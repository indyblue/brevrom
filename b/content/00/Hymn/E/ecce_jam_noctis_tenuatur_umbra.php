<sr>Summer Hymn: After Pentecost, until September 30th inclusive, say:</s>

Lo, fainter now lie spread the shades of night,
And upward shoot the trembling gleams of morn;
Suppliant we bend before the Lord of Light,
And pray at early dawn,â€”

That his sweet charity may all our sin
Forgive, and make our miseries to cease;
May grant us health of soul, grant us delights
Of everlasting peace.

Father supreme! this grace on us confer;
And Thou, O Son by an eternal birth!
With Thee, coequal Spirit Comforter!
Whose glory fills the earth. Amen.
