Dame A. Thomas, OSB, et al.


O rosy dawn! that dost proclaim
Salvation’s happy day,
To thee, O Virgin, ’mid night’s shades,
Thy people humbly pray.

The torrent, that engulfs all those
Within this whirlpool drawn,
Rests calm as o’er its softened wave
The ark of God borne.

While earth is parched with scorching heat,
Alone art thou bedewed;
With dew o’erspread the earth around,
And thou untouched art view’d

The serpent rears his head aloft
Disgorging poisoned spleen;
But thou his proud, inflated head
Dost crush with pow’r as Queen.

O loving Mother, hear our pray’r,
As suppliant we cry;
Protect us in our strife with hell
Who dost its power defy.

O Jesu, born of Virgin bright,
All glory be to thee,
With Father and with Paraclete,
Through all eternity. Amen.
