Fr. E.Caswall


Unloose, great Baptist, our sin-fetter’d lips;
That with enfranchised voice we may proclaim
The miracles of thy transcendent life,
Thy deeds of mighty fame!

Oh, lot sublime! an angel quits the skies,
Thy birth, thy name, thy glory to declare
Unto thy priestly sire; while to the Lord
He offers Israel’s prayer.

Mistrustful of the promise from on high,
His speech forsakes him at the angel’s word;
But thou on thine eighth day dost re-attune
For him the vocal chord.

No marvel; since yet cloister’d in the womb,
The presence of thy King had thee inspired;
What time Elizabeth and Mary sang,
With joy prophetic fired.

Glory immortal to the Father be,
Praise to the sole-begotten sovereign Son,
With Thee, coequal Spirit, One in Three,
While endless ages run. Amen.
