Jesu! the world’ Redeemer, hear;
Thy Bishop’s fadeless crown, draw near:
Accept with gentlest love to-day
The prayers and praises that we pay.

This meek Confessor of thy name
Today attained a glorious fame;
Whose yearly feast, in solemn state,
Thy fatihful people celebrate.

The world and all its boasted good,
As vain and passing, he eschewed;
And therefore with angelic bands,
In endless joy for ever stands.

Grant then that we, most gracious God,
May follow in the steps he trod:
And all his prayer thy servants free
From stain of all iniquity.

To thee, O Christ, our loving King,
All glory, praise, and thanks we bring:
All glory, as is ever meet,
To father and to Paraclete. Amen.
