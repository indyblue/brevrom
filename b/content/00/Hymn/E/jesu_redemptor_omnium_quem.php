J.M.Neale et al.


Jesu, the Ransomer of man,
Who, ere created light began,
Didst from the sovereign Father spring,
His power and glory equaling.

The Father’s Light and Splendour thou,
Their endless Hope to thee that bow:
Accept the prayers and praise today
That through the world thy servants pay.

Salvation’s Author, call to mind
How, taking form of humankind,
Born of a Virgin undefiled
Thou in man’s flesh becam’st a Child.

Thus testifies the present day
Through every year in long array,
That thou, salvation’s source alone,
Proceedest from the Father’s Throne.

The Heavens above, the rolling main
And all that earth’s wide realms contain,
With joyous voice now loudly sing
The glory of their newborn King.

And we who, by thy precious Blood
From sin redeemed, are marked for God,
On this, the day that saw thy Birth,
Sing the new song of ransomed earth.

All honor, laud and glory be,
O Jesu, Virgin-born, to thee;
All glory, as is ever meet,
To Father and to Paraclete. Amen.
