To be the Lamb’s celestial bride
Is Juliana’s one desire;
For this she quits her father’s home,
And leads the sacred virgin choir.

By day, by night, she mourns her Spouse
Nail’d to the Cross, with ceaseless tears;
Till in herself, through very grief,
The image of that Spouse appears.

Like Him, all wounds, she kneels transfix’d
Before the Virgin Mother’s shrine;
And still the more she weeps, the more
Mounts up the flame of love divine.

That love so deep the Lord repaid
His handmaid on her dying bed;
When with the Food of heavenly life
By miracle her soul He fed.

All glory, O Creator Sire,
O sole-begotten Son divine,
And co-eternal Paraclete,
One only Lord and God, be thine. Amen.
