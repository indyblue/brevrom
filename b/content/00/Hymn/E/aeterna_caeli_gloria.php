Eternal Glory of the heavens!
Blest Hope of all on earth!
God, of eternal Godhead born!
Man, by a virgin birth!

Jesu! be near us when we wake;
And, at the break of day,
With thy blest touch arouse the soul,
Her meed of praise to pay.

The star that heralds in the morn
Is fading in the skies;
The darkness melts;—O Thou true Light,
Once more on us arise.

Steep all our senses in thy beam;
The world’s false night expel;
Purge each defilement from the soul,
And in our bosoms dwell.

Come, early Faith! fix in our hearts
Thy root immovably;
Come, smiling Hope! and, greater still,
Come, heaven-born Charity!

To God the Father glory be,
And sole eternal Son;
And glory, Holy Ghost! to Thee,
While endless ages run. Amen.
