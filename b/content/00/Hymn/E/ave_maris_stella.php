<sr>The first strophe of this hymn is sung (or recited) kneeling:</s>

Hail thou Star of ocean!
Portal of the sky!
Ever Virgin Mother
Of the Lord most High!

Oh! by Gabriel’s Ave,
Utter’d long ago,
Eva’s name reversing,
Stablish peace below.

Break the captive’s fetters;
Light on blindness pour;
All our ills expelling,
Every bliss implore.

Shew thyself a Mother;
Offer Him our sighs,
Who for us Incarnate
Did not thee despise.

Virgin of all Virgins!
To thy shelter take us;
Gentlest of the gentle!
Chase and gentle make us.

Still as on we journey,
Help our weak endeavour;
Till with thee and Jesus
We rejoice for ever.

Through the highest Heaven,,
To the Almighty Three,
Father, Son, and Spirit,
One same glory be. Amen.
