Fr. E.Caswall


O Thou! who dost all nature sway,
Dread Trinity in Unity!
Accept the trembling praise we pour
To thy eternal Majesty.

The star that heraldeth the dawn
Is slowly fading in the skies;
The darkness melts;—O Thou true light!
Upon our darken’d souls arise.

To God the Father glory be,
And to the sole-begotten Son,
And Holy Ghost co-equally,
While everlasting ages run. Amen.
