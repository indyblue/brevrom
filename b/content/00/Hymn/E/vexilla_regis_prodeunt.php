Abroad the regal banners fly,
Now shines the Cross’s mystery:
Upon it Life did death endure,
And yet by death did life procure.

Who, wounded with a direful spear,
Did purposely to wash us clear
From stain of sin, pour out a flood
Of precious water mixed with blood.

That which the prophet-king of old
Hath in mysterious verse foretold,
Is now accomplished, whilst we see
God ruling the nations from a Tree.

O lovely and refulgent Tree,
Adorned with purpled majesty;
Culled from a worthy stock, to bear
Those limbs which sanctified were.

Blest Tree, whose happy branches bore
The wealth that did the world restore;
The beam that did that Body weigh
Which raised up Hell’s expected prey.

<sr>During this stanza all kneel:</s>

Hail Cross, of hopes the most sublime!
Now, in the mournful Passion time;
Grant to the just increase of grace,
And every sinner’s crimes efface.

Blest Trinity, salvation’s spring
May every soul Thy praises sing;
To those Thou grantest conquest by
The Holy Cross, rewards supply. Amen.
