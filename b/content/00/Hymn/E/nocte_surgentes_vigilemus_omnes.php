Fr. E.Caswall


Let us arise and watch ere dawn of light,
And to the Lord our hearts and voices raise;
And meditate in psalms, and all unite
In holy hymns of praise.

So, blending here our strains to God on high,
Hereafter, in the courts of Heavenâ€™s great King,
May we be meet his praise eternally
Among his Saints to sing.

Father supreme! this grace on us confer,
And Thou, O Son by an eternal birth!
With thee, coequal Spirit Comforter!
Whose glory fills the earth. Amen.
