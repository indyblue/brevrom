Fr. E.Caswall


Now, while the herald bird of day
Announces morning bright;
Christ also, speaking in the soul,
Wakes her to life and light.

Take up your beds, we hear him say
No more in slumber lie;
In justice, truth, and temperance,
Keep watch;—your Lord is nigh.

O Jesus! art Thou nigh indeed?—
Then let us watch and weep;
This truth but once in earnest felt
Forbids the heart to sleep.

Break, Lord, the spell that wraps us round
In deadly bonds of night;
Unbind the chains of former guilt;
Renew in us thy light.

To God the Father glory be,
And sole eternal Son;
And glory, Holy Ghost! to Thee,
While endless ages run. Amen.
