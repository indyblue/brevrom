Now in the sun’s new dawning ray,
Lowly of heart, our God we pray
That He from harm may keep us free
In all the deeds this day shall see.

May fear of Him our tongues restrain,
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:
His favoring care our guardian be,
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.

May every heart be pure from sin,
And folly find no place therein:
Scant meed of food, excess denied,
Wear down in us the body’s pride

That when the light of day is gone,
And night in course shall follow on,
We, free from cares the world affords,
May chant the praises that is our Lord’s.

All laud to God the Father be,
All praise, Eternal Son, to Thee;
All glory, as is ever meet,
To God the Holy Paraclete. Amen.
