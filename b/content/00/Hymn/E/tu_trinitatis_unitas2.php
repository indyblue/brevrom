Fr. E.Caswall


O Thou! who dost all nature sway,
Dread Trinity in Unity!
Accept the trembling praise we pay
To thy eternal Majesty.

For one and all we now arise,
While solemn midnight breathes around,
To seek from Thee, with tears and sighs,
A healing balm of every wound.

Almighty Lord! whatever guilt
Satan hath wrought in us this night,
Oh may it now before Thee melt
As mist before the morning light.

Grant us a body pure within;
A wakeful heart, a ready will;
Grant us, by no deep cherishâ€™d sin,
The fervour of the soul to chill.

Kindle our minds, Redeemer true,
With thy most pure celestial ray;
So may we walk in safety through
All the temptations of the day.

Father of mercies! hear our cry;
Hear us, coequal Son!
Who reignest with the Holy Ghost
While endless ages run. Amen.
