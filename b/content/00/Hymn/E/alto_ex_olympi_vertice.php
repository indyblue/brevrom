Fr. E.Caswall


From highest heav’n, the Father’s Son,
Descending like that mystic stone
Cut from a mountain without hands,
Came down below, and fill’d all lands;
Uniting, midway in the sky,
His House on earth, and House on high.

That House on high,—it ever rings
With praises of the King of kings;
Forever there, on harps divine,
They hymn th’ eternal One and Trine;
We, here below, the strain prolong,
And faintly echo Sion’s song.

O Lord of lords invisible!
With thy pure light this temple fill:
Hither, oft as invoked, descend;
Here to thy people’s prayer attend;
Here, through all hearts, forever more,
Thy Spirit’s quick’ning graces pour.

Here may the faithful, day by day,
Their hearts’ adoring homage pay;
And here receive from thy dear love
The blessings of that home above;
Till loosen’d from this mortal chain,
Its everlasting joys they gain.

To God the Father, glory due
Be paid by all the heavenly host;
And to his only Son most true;
With thee, O mighty Holy Ghost!
To whom, praise, power, and blessing be,
Through th’ ages of eternity. Amen.
