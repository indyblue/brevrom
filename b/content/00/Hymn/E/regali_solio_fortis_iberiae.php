Fr. E.Caswall


Glory of Iberia’s throne!
Joy of Martyr’d Saints above!
Who the crown of life have won,
Dying for their Saviour’s love:

What intrepid faith was thine
In thy every thought and deed!
Bent to do the will divine
Wheresoever it might lead.

Every rising motion check’d
Which might lead thy heart astray;
How thou didst thy course direct
Whither virtue shew’d the way!

Honour, glory, blessing, praise,
To the Father, and the Son,
With the Spirit, through all days,
While eternal ages run. Amen.
