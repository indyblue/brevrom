The eternal gifts of Christ, the King,
The Apostles' glory, let us sing!
Let all with hearts of gladness raise,
Due hymns of thankfulness and praise.

The princes of the Church are they,
Her chiefs triumphant in the fray,
The heavenly King's own warrior band,
True lights, to lighten every land.

Theirs was the stedfast faith of Saints,
The hope that never yields nor faints,
The love of Christ in full degree,
Victorious o'er sin's tyranny.

In them the Father's glory shone,
In them the Spirit's will was done,
The Son himself exults in them;
Joy fills the new Jerusalem.

Praise to the Father, with the Son,
And Holy Spirit, Three in One;
As ever was in ages past,
And so shall be while ages last.  Amen.
