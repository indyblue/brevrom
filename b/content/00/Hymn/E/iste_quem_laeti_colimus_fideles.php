Worshipp’d throughout the Church to earth’s far ends
With prayer and solemn rite,
Joseph this day triumphantly ascends
Into the realms of light.

Oh, blest beyond the lot of mortal men!
O’er whose last dying sigh,
Christ and the Virgin Mother watch’d serene,
Soothing his agony.

Loosed from his fleshly chain, gently he fleets
As in calm sleep away;
And diadem’d with light, enters the seats
Of everlasting day.

There throned in pow’r, let us his loving aid
With fervent prayers implore;
So may he gain us pardon in our need,
And peace for evermore.

Glory and praise to Thee, blest Trinity!
One only God and Lord,
Who to thy faithful ones unfailingly
Their aureoles dost award. Amen.
