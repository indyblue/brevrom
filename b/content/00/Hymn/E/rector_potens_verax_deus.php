J.M.Neale


O God of truth, O Lord of might,
Who orderest time and change aright,
And sendest the early morning ray,
And lightest the glow of perfect day.

Extinguish Thou each sinful fire,
And banish every ill desire:
And while Thou keepest the body whole
Shed forth Thy peace upon the soul.

Almighty Father, hear our cry
Through Jesus Christ, Our Lord most High
Who, with the Holy Ghost and Thee,
Doth live and reign eternally. Amen.
