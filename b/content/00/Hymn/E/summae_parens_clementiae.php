O Thou eternal Source of love!
Ruler of nature’s scheme!
In Substance One, in Persons Three!
Omniscient and Supreme!

For thy dear mercy’s sake receive
The strains and tears we pour,
And purify our hearts to taste
Thy sweetness more and more.

Our flesh, our reins, our spirits, Lord,
In thy clear fire refine;
Break down the self-indulgent will;
Gird us with strength divine.

So may all we, who here are met
By night thy name to bless,
One day, in our eternal home,
Thy promises possess.

Father of mercies! hear our cry;
Hear us, coequal Son!
Who reignest with the Holy Ghost
While endless ages run. Amen.
