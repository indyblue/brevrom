Fr. E.Caswall


Flowers of martyrdom all hail!
Smitten by the tyrant foe
On life’s threshold,—as the gale
Strews the roses ere they blow.

First to bleed for Christ, sweet lambs!
What a simple death ye died!
Sporting with your wreaths and palms,
At the very altar side!

Honour, glory, virtue, merit,
Be to Thee, O Virgin’s Son!
With the Father, and the Spirit,
While eternal ages run. Amen.
