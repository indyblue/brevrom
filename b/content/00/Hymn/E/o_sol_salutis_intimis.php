Fr. E.Caswall


The darkness fleets, and joyful earth
Welcomes the newborn day;
Jesu, true Sun of human souls!
Shed in our souls thy ray.

Shed in our souls thy ray.
Thou, who dost give the accepted time,
Give tears to purify,
Give flames of love to burn our hearts

That fountain, whence our sins have flow’d,
Shall soon in tears distill,
If but thy penitential grace
Subdue the stubborn will.

The day is near when all re-blooms,
Thy own blest day, O Lord;
We too would joy, by thy right hand
To life’s true path restored.

All glorious Trinity! to Thee
Let earth’s vast fabric bend;
And evermore from souls renew’d
The Saints’ new song ascend. Amen.
