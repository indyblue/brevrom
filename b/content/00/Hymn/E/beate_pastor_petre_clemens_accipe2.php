Fr. E.Caswall


Peter, blest Shepherd! hearken to our cry,
And with a word unloose our guilty chain;
Thou! who hast power to ope the gates on high
To men below, and power to shut them fast again.

Lead us, great teacher Paul, in wisdom’s ways,
And lift our hearts with thine to heaven’s high throne;
Till faith beholds the clear meridian blaze,
And sunlike in the soul reigns charity alone.

Praise, blessing, majesty, through endless days,
Be to the Trinity immortal given;
Who in pure Unity profoundly sways
Eternally alike all things in earth and Heaven. Amen.
