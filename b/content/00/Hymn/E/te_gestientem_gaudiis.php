Dame A. Thomas, OSB, et al.


Exulting with exceeding joy,
Or pierced with sorrow’s wound,
O Virgin Mother, thee we sing,
In glory clothed around.

Conception, Visitation, Birth,
The off’ring of thy Child,
The Finding-these thy joys we hail,
O Virgin Mother mild.

Hail in thy share of agony—
Stripes, thorny crown, yea most
When ’neath the Cross thou dauntless stood,
O Queen of martyrs’ host!

Then in the triumph of thy Son,—
The fire of Paraclete,—
O Queen, refulgent in his light,
We hail thy crown complete.

O come, ye nations, gather here
These mystic roses fair,
And weave a garland for the Queen
Of love beyond compare.

O Jesu, born of Virgin Bright,
All glory be to thee,
With Father and with Paraclete,
Through all eternity. Amen.
