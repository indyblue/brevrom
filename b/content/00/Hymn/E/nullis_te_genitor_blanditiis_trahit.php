Fr. E.Caswall


From the Truth thy soul to turn,
Pleads a father’s voice in vain;
Nought to thee were jewell’d crown,
Earthly pleasure, earthly gain.

Angry threat and naked sword
Daunted not thy courage high;
Choosing glory with the Lord,
Rather than a present joy.

Now amid the Saints in light,
Throned in bliss for evermore;—
Oh! from thy exalted height,
Hear the solemn prayer we pour.

Honour, glory, blessing, praise,
To the Father, and the Son,
With the Spirit, through all days,
While eternal ages run. Amen.
