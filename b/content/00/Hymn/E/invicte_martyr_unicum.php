Fr. E.Caswall


Martyr of unconquer'd might!
Follower of th' Incarnate Son!
Who, victroious in the fight,
Hast celestial glory won;

By the virtue of thy prayer,
Let no evil hover nigh;
Sin's contagion drive afar;
Waken drowsy lethargy.

Loosen'd from the fleshly chain,
Which detain'd thee here of old,
Loose us from the bonds of sin,
From the fetters of the world.

Glory to the Father be;
Glory to th' incarnate Son;
Glory, Holy Ghost, to Thee,
While eternal ages run. Amen.
