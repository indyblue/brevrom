O Virgin, clothed by the sun's rays
A crown of twelve stars upon thy head;
The moon is made thy footstool:
Thou glorious radiant one!

O woman who subdues hell and death,
From the side of Christ, eagerly watching over us;
Heaven and earth glorifies
Their mighty queen.

But the terrible serpant persists
In threatening the people now given to thee;
Merciful Mother, come to our aid, 
and break the necks of the malignant.

Protect the followers of the divinely inspired faith;
Lead those who go astray back to the holy sheepfold:
Protect all nations from the shadow of death,
gathering them from everywhere.

Gracious pardon we beg for us sinners,
Give aid the helpless and afflicted;
To all who fearfully tremble, be the light
Which promises sure hope of salvation.

Continual praise be to the most high Trinity,
Who to thee, O Virgin, bestow the crown;
Thus establishing thee as our Queen
and provident Mother. Amen.
