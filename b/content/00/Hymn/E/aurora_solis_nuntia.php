O dawn announcing the sun
Beginning the month of flowering;
The workman's resounding hammer
Salutes the home at Nazareth.

Hail, head of the household
Beneath whom is the supreme Artificer;
Who, bedewed with salty sweat,
Exercises his father's trade.

He was placed on a high seat
nearest to his Noble Spouse;
be near now to all thy clients
who are troubled by indigency.

Strength and strife be absent!
and all defrauding of wages;
May copious nourishment of food
be limited only by moderation.

O Trinity, O Unity,
by the prayers of Joseph;
Direct in peace 
all our steps and our path. Amen.
