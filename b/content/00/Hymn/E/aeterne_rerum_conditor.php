<sr>Winter Hymn: On Sundays after Epiphany, from January 14th until Lent, and after Pentecost, from October 1 until November 26th inclusive, say:</s>

Dread Framer of the earth and sky!
Who dost the circling seasons give!
And all the cheerful change supply
Of alternating morn and eve!

Light of our darksome journey here,
With days dividing night from night!—
Loud crows the dawn’s shrill harbinger,
And wakens up the sunbeams bright.

Forthwith at this, the darkness chill
Retreats before the star of morn;
And from their busy schemes of ill,
The vagrant crews of night return.

Fresh hope, at this, the sailor cheers;
The waves their stormy strife allay;
The Church’s Rock at this, in tears,
Hastens to wash his guilt away.

Arise ye, then, with one accord!
Nor longer wrapt in slumber lie;
The cock rebukes all who their Lord
By sloth neglect, by sin deny.

At his clear cry joy springs afresh;
Health courses through the sick man’s veins:
The dagger glides into its sheath;
The fallen soul her faith regains.

Jesu! look on us when we fall;—
One momentary glance of thine
Can from her guilt the soul recal
To tears of penitence divine.

Awake us from false sleep profound,
And through our senses pour thy light;
Be thy blest name the first we sound
At early dawn, the last at night.

To God the Father glory be,
And to his sole-begotten Son;
Glory, O Holy Ghost! to Thee,
While everlasting ages run. Amen.
