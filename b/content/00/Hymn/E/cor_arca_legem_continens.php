Fr. E.Caswall


Ark of the Covenant! not that
Whence bondage came of old;
But that of pure forgiving grace
And mercies manifold,

Thou Veil of awful mystery!
Thou Sanctuary sublime!
Thou sacred Temple, holier far
Than that of olden time!

Blest Heart of Christ! in thy dear wound
The hidden depth we see,
Of what were else unguess’d by us,—
His boundless charity.

Beneath this emblem of pure love,
Twas Love Himself that died,
And offer’d up Himself for us,
A Victim crucified.

Oh, who of his redeem’d will Him
Their mutual love refuse?
Who would not rather in that heart
Their home eternal choose?

To God the Father, with the Son,
And, Holy Ghost, to Thee,
Be honour, glory, virtue, power,
Through all eternity. Amen.
