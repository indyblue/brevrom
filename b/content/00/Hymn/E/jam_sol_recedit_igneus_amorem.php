Fr. E.Caswall


Now doth the fiery sun decline: —
Thou, Unity eternal! shine;
Thou, Trinity, thy blessings pour,
And make our hearts with love run o’er.

Thee in the hymns of morn we praise;
To Thee our voice at eve we raise;
Oh, grant us, with thy Saints on high,
Thee through all time to glorify.

Praise to the Father, with the Son,
And Holy Spirit, Three in One;
As ever was in ages past,
And so shall be while ages last. Amen.
