Saint of sweetest majesty!
What a potent voice is thine!
At thy prayer diseases fly;
Fading health revives again.

Oft with wasting fever wan,
Lingering at their latest breath,
Dying men by thee are drawn
From the very jaws of death.

Oft the stores of golden grain,
Hurried down the swollen flood,
At thy prayer return again
Guided by the hand of God!

Such, O happy Saint in light,
Such thy help in hour of need,
Oh, then from the heavenly height
Hearken now and intercede.

Everlasting Three in One!
Everlasting One in Three!
Grant us through thy Saint the boon
Of a blest eternity. Amen.
