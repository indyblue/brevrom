Dame A. Thomas, OSB, et al.


Sing, O ye faithful, sing two athlete brothers,
Welcomed above to thrones of light supernal;
Sing of Slavonia’s race the glory twofold
And strength eternal.

One love these brethren bound in sweetest union
By pity same their solitude is broken;
Forth they would hasten, unto many bearing
Life’s blessed token.

Soon o’er Bulgaria, Moravia, Bohemia,
Light from the heav’nly temple shineth glorious.
Once savage hordes, now countless flocks to Peter
Lead they victorious.

Now with the well-earned crown your brow encircled,
Hear, the blessed ones, to suppliant tears bending;
Unto the Slavs, erst by your gifts enriched,
Protection lending.

Oh! may each gen’rous land, your aid imploring,
Keep bright the faith through every generation;
Rome to that land first gave, and ever guardeth,
Life and salvation.

Lord! of our race Creator and Redeemer,
By nature good, all goods on us bestowing,
Glory to thee thro’ ages all, from grateful
Hearts overflowing. Amen.
