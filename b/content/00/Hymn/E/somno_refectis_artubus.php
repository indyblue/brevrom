Fr. E.Caswall


Our limbs with tranquil sleep refreshâ€™d,
Lightly from bed we spring;
Father supreme! to us be nigh,
While thy praise we sing.

Thy love be first in every heart,
Thy name on every tongue;
Whatever we this day may do,
May it in Thee be done.

Soon will the morning star arise,
And chase the dusk away;
The guilt that may have come with night,
May it depart with day.

Cut off in us whatever root
Of sin or shame there be;
So evermore from bosoms pure
Be rendered praise to Thee.

Father of mercies! hear our cry;
Hear us, coequal Son!
Who reignest with the Holy Ghost
While endless ages run. Amen.
