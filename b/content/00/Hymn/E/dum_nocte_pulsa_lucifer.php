Fr. E.Caswall


The golden star of morn
Is climbing in the sky;
The birth-day of Venantius
Awakes the Church to joy.

His native land in depths
Of Pagan darkness lay;
He o’er her guilty regions pour’d
The dawn of Heavenly day;

When in the gracious stream
He did her sons baptize,
Transmitting those who came to slay
As martyrs to the skies.

With Angels now he shares
Delights that never cease;—
Look down on us, O Spirit blest,
And send us gifts of peace.

All honour, glory, praise,
Blest Trinity, to Thee;
Oh, grant us through thy Martyr’s prayer
Joys of eternity. Amen.
