Fr. E.Caswall


Laud we the Saint most sweet
Shining in glory blest,
Who bore a hero’s noble heart
Within a woman’s breast.

Pierced with the love of Christ
The world’s false love she fled;
And Heavenward with might and main
Upon her journey sped.

With fasts she pined the flesh,
But on sweet food of prayer
Feasted her spirit pure; and now
Doth joys eternal share.

O Christ our King and God!
Thou strength of all the strong!
To whom alone all holy deeds,
And all great works belong;

To God the Father glory be,
And to His sole-begotten Son;
Glory, O Holy Ghost, to Thee,
While everlasting ages run. Amen.
