J.M.Neale et al.


The Apostles’ hearts were full of pain
For their dear Lord so lately slain,
By rebel servants doomed to die
A death of cruel agony.

With gentle voice the angel gave
The women tidings at the grave:
“Fear not, your Master shall ye see;
He goes before to Galilee.”

Then hastening on their eager way
The joyful tidings to convey,
Their Lord they met, their living Lord,
And, falling at his feet, adored.

The Eleven, when they hear, with speed
To Galilee forthwith proceed,
That there once more they may behold
The Lord’s dear face, as he foretold.

O Lord of all, with us abide
In this our joyful Eastertide;
From every weapon death can wield
Thine own redeemed for ever shield.

¶ All laud to God the Father be;
All praise, Eternal Son, to Thee;
All glory, as is ever meet,
To God the Holy Paraclete. Amen.

¶ <sr>In Ascensiontide (From Ascension Thursday until Friday before the Vigil of Pentecost inclusive):</s>

All glory, Lord, to Thee we pay,
Ascending o’er the stars to-day;
All glory, as is ever meet;
To Father and to Paraclete. Amen.
