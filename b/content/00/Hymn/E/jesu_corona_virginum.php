J.M.Neale


Jesu, the Virgins’ Crown, do thou
Accept us, as in prayer we bow;
Born of that Virgin, whom alone
The Mother and the Maid we own.

Amongst the lilies thou dost feed,
With virgin choirs accompanied;
With glory deck’d, the spotless brides
Whose bridal gifts thy love provides.

They, wheresoe’er thy footsteps bend,
With hymns and praises still attend;
In blessed troops they follow thee,
With dance, and song, and melody.

We pray thee therefore to bestow
Upon our senses here below
Thy grace, that so we may endure
From taint of all corruption pure.

To God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit, Three in One,
Laud, honour, might, and glory be,
From age to age eternally. Amen.
