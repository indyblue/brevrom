Ruler of the dread immense!
Maker of this mighty frame!
Whose eternal Providence
Guides it, as from Thee it came!

Prone before thy face we bend;
Hear our supplicating cries;
And thy light celestial send,
With the freshly dawning skies.

King of kings! and Lord most high!
This of thy dear love we pray,—
May thy Guardian Angel nigh
Keep us from all sin this day.

May he crush the deadly wiles
Of the envious Serpent’s art,
Ever spreading cunning toils
Round about the thoughtless heart.

May he scatter ruthless war,
Ere to this our land it come;
Plague and famine drive afar;
Fix securely peace at home.

Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
One eternal Trinity!
Guard by thy Angelic host
Us, who put our trust in Thee. Amen.
