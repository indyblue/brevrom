Fr. E.Caswall


The pall of night o’ershades the earth,
And hides the tints of day;—
O thou! to whom no night comes near,
Dread Judge! to Thee we pray:

That all our guilt Thou wilt remove,
And our lost peace restore;
And of thy mercy grant us grace
Thee to offend no more.

The guilty soul, which all too long
In lethargy hath lain,
Yearns to cast off her load, and seek
Her Saviour’s face again.

Expel from her the darkness, Lord,
Of her internal night;
Renew her bliss—renew in her
Thy beatific light.

Father of mercies! hear our cry;
Hear us, coequal Son!
Who reignest with the Holy Ghost
While endless ages run. Amen.
