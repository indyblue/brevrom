Fr. E.Caswall


Joseph, pure Spouse of that immortal Bride,
Who shines in ever-virgin glory bright,
Through all the Christian climes thy praise be sung;
Through all the realms of light.

Thee, when amazed concern for thy betrothed
Had fill’d thy righteous spirit with dismay,
An Angel visited, and with blest words,
Scatter’d thy fears away.

Thine arms embraced thy Maker newly born;
With Him to Egypt’s desert didst thou flee;
Him in Jerusalem did seek and find;
Oh grief, oh joy for thee!

Not until after death their blissful crown
Others obtain; but unto thee was given,
In thine own lifetime to enjoy thy God,
As do the blest in Heaven.

Grant us, great Trinity, for Joseph’s sake,
Unto the starry mansions to attain;
There, with glad tongues, thy praise to celebrate
In one eternal strain. Amen.
