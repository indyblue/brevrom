Son of a Virgin, Maker of thy Mother,
Thou, Rod and Blossom from a Stem unstain√®d,
Thou, King of Virgins, hearken as we honour
Virginal glories.

Fountain of mercy, hear the sweet petitions,
Of thine own Blessed whom today we honour;
Cleanse our defilements, so that we may praise thee
Meetly in heaven.

Praise God the Father, and his Sole-Begotten,
Made of a Woman God incarnate ever,
With God the Spirit; Three in One co-equal
Throughout all ages. Amen.
