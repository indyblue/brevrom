Jesu! eternal Truth sublime!
Through endless years the same!
Thou crown of those who through all time
Confess thy holy Name:

Thy suppliant people, through the prayer
Of thy blest Saint, forgive;
For his dear sake thy wrath forbear,
And bid our spirits live.

Again returns the sacred day,
With heavenly glory bright,
Which saw him go upon his way
Into the realms of light.

All objects of our vain desire,
All earthly joys and gains,
To him were but as filthy mire;
And now with Thee he reigns.

Thee, Jesu, his all-gracious Lord,
Confessing to the last,
He trod beneath him Satanâ€™s fraud,
And stood for ever fast.

In holy deeds of faith and love,
In fastings and in prayers,
His days were spent; and now above
Thy heavenly Feast he shares.

Then, for his sake thy wrath lay by,
And hear us while we pray;
And pardon us, O Thou most high,
On this his festal Day.

All glory to the Father be;
And sole Incarnate Son;
Praise, holy Paraclete, to Thee;
While endless ages run. Amen.
