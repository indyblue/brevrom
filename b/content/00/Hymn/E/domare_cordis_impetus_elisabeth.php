Fr. E.Caswall


Pure, meek, with soul serene,
Sweeter to her it was to serve unseen
Her God, than reign a queen.

Now far above our sight,
Enthroned upon the star-paved azure height,
She reigns in realms of light;

So long as time shall flow,
Teaching to all who sit on thrones below,
The good that power can do.

To God, the Sire and Son
And Paraclete, be glory, Trine in One,
While endless ages run. Amen.
