Fr. E.Caswall


O Thou true life of all that live!
Who dost, unmoved, all motion sway;
Who dost the morn and evening give,
And through its changes guide the day:

Thy light upon our evening pour, â€”
So may our souls no sunset see;
But death to us an open door
To an eternal morning be.

Father of mercies! hear our cry;
Hear us, O sole-begotten Son!
Who, with the Holy Ghost most high,
Reignest while endless ages run. Amen.
