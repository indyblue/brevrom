Fr. E.Caswall


The Word, descending from above,
Though with the Father still on high,
Went forth upon his work of love,
And soon to life’s last eve drew nigh.

He shortly to a death accursed
By a disciple shall be given;
But, to his twelve disciples, first
He gives Himself, the Bread from Heaven.

Himself in either kind He gave;
He gave his Flesh, He gave his Blood;
Of flesh and blood all men are made;
And He of man would be the Food. 

At birth our brother He became;
At meat Himself as food He gives;
To ransom us He died in shame;
As our reward, in bliss He lives.

O saving Victim! opening wide
The gate of Heav’n to man below!
Sore press our foes from every side;
Thine aid supply, thy strength bestow.

To thy great Name be endless praise,
Immortal Godhead, One in Three!
Oh, grant us endless length of days,
In our true native land, with Thee! Amen.
