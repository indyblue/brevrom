Pope Leo XIII


O Light all beauteous of the Fatherland,
And of the Sclavonic race benignant Ray,—
Brethren, all hail! To you,
Our yearly canticle we bring;

Whom Rome applauding, did receive,
As Mother pressing to her heart, loved sons,—
She upon your brow, the Bishop’s diadem doth place,
And girdeth with new strength!

Ye penetrate to furthest barbarous lands,
To bring them Christ.
Where error vain did darkly play,
Ye there pour in the radiance of fair light.

On hearts unshackled from the grasp of ill,
Doth heavenly ardour seize;
Thorns’ horrid aspect now is changed
For flowers of holiness.

Then deign, O ye who reign
Secure in courts celestial,
To turn unto our suppliant prayer:
Preserve unto God the Sclavonic people.

May the one Fold of Christ
Enclose those in error plunged:
Emulating the deeds of their forefathers,
May faith revive more beauteous still.

O Thou, Most Blessed Trinity,
Spur us on, by heavenly Love;
And grant that the sons may follow
In the noble footprints of their sires! Amen.
