Fr. E.Caswall


Pure Light of light! eternal day;
Who dost the Father’s brightness share;
Our chant the midnight silence breaks;—
Be nigh, and hearken to our prayer.

Scatter the darkness of our minds,
And turn the hosts of hell to flight;
Let not our souls in sloth repose,
And sleeping sink in endless night.

O Christ! for thy dear mercy’s sake,
Spare us, who put our trust in Thee;
Nor let our early hymn ascend
In fain to thy pure Majesty.

Father of mercies! hear our cry;
Hear us, coequal Son!
Who reignest with the Holy Ghost
While endless ages run. Amen.
