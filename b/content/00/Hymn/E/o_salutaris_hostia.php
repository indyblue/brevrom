Fr. E.Caswall


O saving Victim! opening wide
The gate of Heavâ€™n to man below!
Sore press our foes from every side;
Thine aid supply, thy strength bestow.

To thy great Name be endless praise,
Immortal Godhead, One in Three!
Oh, grant us endless length of days,
In our true native land, with Thee! Amen.
