Now daily shines the sun more fair,
Recalling that blest time,
When Christ on his apostles shone,
In radiant light sublime.

They in his Body see the wounds
Like stars divinely glow;
Then forth, as his true Witnesses,
Throughout the world they go.

O Christ! thou King most merciful!
Our inmost hearts possess;
So may our canticles of praise
Thy name for ever bless.

Keep us, O Jesu! from the death
Of sin; and deign to be
The everlasting Paschal joy
Of all new-born to Thee.

¶ Praise to the Father, and the Son,
Who from the dead arose;
Praise to the blessed Paraclete,
While age on ages flows. Amen.

¶ <sr>In Ascensiontide (From Ascension Thursday until Friday before the Vigil of Pentecost inclusive):</s>
All glory, Lord, to Thee we pay,
Ascending o’er the stars to-day;
All glory, as is ever meet;
To Father and to Paraclete. Amen.
