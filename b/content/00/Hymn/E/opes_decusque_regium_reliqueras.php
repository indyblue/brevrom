Fr. E.Caswall


Riches and regal throne, for Christâ€™s dear sake,
True Saint, thou didst despise;
Amid the angels seated now in bliss,
Oh, help us from the skies!

Guide us; and fill our days with perfume sweet
Of loving word and deed;
So teaches us thy beauteous charity,
By fragrant roses hid.

O Charity! what power is thine! by thee
Above the stars we soar;
In thee be purest praise to Father, Son,
And Spirit, evermore. Amen.
