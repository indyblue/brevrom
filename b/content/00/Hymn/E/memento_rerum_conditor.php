Fr. E.Caswall


Remember, O Creator Lord,
That in the Virginâ€™s sacred womb
Thou wast conceived, and of her flesh
Didst our mortality assume.

Mother of grace, O Mary blest,
To thee, sweet fount of love, we fly;
Shield us through life, and take us hence
To thy dear bosom when we die.

O Jesu! born of Virgin bright,
Immortal glory be to Thee;
Praise to the Father infinite,
And Holy Ghost eternally. Amen.
