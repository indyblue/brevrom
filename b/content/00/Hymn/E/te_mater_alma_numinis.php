Fr. E.Caswall


Mother of Almighty God!
Suppliant at thy feet we pray;
Shelter us from Satan’s fraud,
Safe beneath thy wing this day.

Twas by reason of our Fall,
In our first Forefather’s crime,
That the mighty Lord of all
Raised thee to thy rank sublime.

Oh then upon Adam’s race
Look thou with a pitying eye;
And entreat of Jesus grace,
Till He lay his anger by.

Honour, glory, virtue, merit,
Be to Thee, O Virgin’s Son!
With the Father and the Spirit,
While eternal ages run. Amen.
