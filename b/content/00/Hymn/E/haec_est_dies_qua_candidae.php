Fr. E.Caswall


This day, beneath the form
Of a pure snow-white dove,
Teresa’s unbound spirit sought
The Sanctuary above;

And heard the Bridegroom’s voice,—
Sister from Carmel come;
Come to the marriage of the Lamb,
To thy eternal home.

Spouse of the Virgin choir!
Let all the blest adore
Thee, Jesu! and in nuptial songs
Extol Thee evermore. Amen.
