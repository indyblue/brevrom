Unk.


By Mary’s inspiration led,
A sevenfold offspring comes to light;
At Mary’s call away they sped
To Mount Senario’s rugged height.

What fruits of grace the earth shall bear
When they have sown their seeds divine!
Christ’s vine shall bud with clusters rare,
Empurpled with the ruddy wine.

A holy death to heaven speeds
The souls with virtue’s glory crowned;
When Mary for her servants pleads,
Heaven’s blessed portals they have found.

O happy souls who now obtain
The Kingdom, and the sceptre bear,
Look down on us who still remain
Where Satan spreads his subtle snare.

Therefore on bended knee we pray,
For sake of Mary’s bitter grief;
Chase darkness from our mind away,
And give our troubled hearts relief.

And thou, O Trinity Divine!
Confirm us in thy holy grace!
That so we may our hearts incline
To walk in these thy servants’ ways. Amen.
