Dame A. Thomas, OSB, et al.


The heavenly messenger reveals
A myst’ry all divine;
A Virgin Mother full of grace
He hails with reverent sign.

Then Mary to her cousin speeds,
And scarce her voice is heard,
Ere John the Baptist yet unborn
Proclaims the incarnate Word.

The Word that in th’ Eternal Mind
Abode ere time began,
An Infant is of Mary born,
With life of mortal span.

The Little One that made the law
Obeys its every claim,
And is redeemed at lowly price
Who for our ransom came.

And now the joyous Mother finds
The Son she sorrowing sought,
Revealing myst’ries unto men
In legal doctrine taught.

O Jesu, born of Virgin bright,
All glory be to thee,
With Father and with Paraclete,
Through all eternity. Amen.
