<sr>The first strophe of this hymn is sung (or recited) kneeling:</s>

Come, O Creator Spirit blest!
And in our souls take up thy rest;
Come, with thy grace and heavenly aid,
To fill the hearts which Thou hast made.

Great Paraclete! to Thee we cry:
O highest gift of God most high!
O fount of life! O fire of love!
And solemn Unction from above!

The sacred sevenfold grace is thine
Dread Finger of the hand divine!
The promise of the Father Thou!
Who dost the tongue with power endow.

Our senses touch with light and fire;
Our hearts with charity inspire;
And, with endurance from on high
The weakness of our flesh supply.

Far back our enemy repel,
And let thy peace within us dwell,
So may we having Thee for guide
Turn from each hurtful thing aside.

O may thy grace on us bestow
The Father and the Son to know,
And evermore to hold confessâ€™d
Thyself of Each the Spirit blest.

To God the Father praise be paid,
Praise to the Son who from the dead
Arose, and perfect praise to Thee
O Holy Ghost eternally. Amen.
