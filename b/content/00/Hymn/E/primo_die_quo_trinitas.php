This day the glorious Trinity
Creation’s work began;
This day the world’s Creator rose,
O’ercoming death for man.

Casting betimes dull sloth away,
We too will rise by night;
And with the Prophet seek the Lord,
Before the dawning light.

So may He stretch his hand to save
And hear us in his love;
And renovate us by his grace,
For our true home above.

So, while on this holy Day,
At this most sacred hour,
Our psalms amid the stillness rise,
May He his blessings shower.

Father of lights! keep us this day
From sinful passions free;
Grant us, in every word, and deed,
And thought, to honour Thee.

Assist us, Purity divine,
Within our hearts to quell
Those evil fires, which cherish’d here
Augment the flames of hell.

Saviour, of thy sweet clemency,
Wash Thou our sins away;
Grant us thy peace—grant us with Thee
Thine own eternal day.

Father of mercies! hear our cry;
Hear us, coequal Son!
Who reignest with the Holy Ghost
While endless ages run. Amen.
