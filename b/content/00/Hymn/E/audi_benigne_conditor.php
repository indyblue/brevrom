Fr. E.Caswall


Thou loving Maker of mankind,
Before thy throne we pray and weep;
Oh, strengthen us with grace divine,
Duly this sacred Lent to keep.

Searcher of hearts! Thou dost discern
Our ills, and all our weakness know:
Again to Thee with tears we turn;
Again to us thy mercy show.

Much have we sinnâ€™d; but we confess
Our guilt, and all our faults deplore:
Oh, for the praise of thy great Name,
Our fainting souls to health restore!

And grant us, while by fasts we strive
This mortal body to control,
To fast from all the food of sin,
And so to purify the soul.

Hear us, O Trinity thrice blest!
Sole Unity! to Thee we cry:
Vouchsafe us from these fasts below
To reap immortal fruit on high. Amen.
