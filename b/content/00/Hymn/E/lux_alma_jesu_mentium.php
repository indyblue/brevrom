Fr. E.Caswall


Light of the soul, O Saviour blest!
Soon as thy presence fills the breast,
Darkness and guilt are put to flight,
And all is sweetness and delight.

Son of the Father! Lord most high!
How glad is he who feels Thee nigh!
How sweet in Heav’n thy beam doth glow,
Denied to eye of flesh below!

O Light of Light celestial!
O Charity ineffable!
Come in thy hidden majesty;
Fill us with love, fill us with Thee.

To Jesus, from the proud conceal’d,
But evermore to babes reveal’d,
All glory with the Father be,
And Holy Ghost, eternally. Amen.
