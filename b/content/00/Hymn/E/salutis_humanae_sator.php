Hail, thou who man’s Redeemer art,
Jesu, the joy of every heart;
Great maker of the world’s wide frame,
And purest love’s delight and flame:

What nameless mercy thee o’ercame,
To bear our load of sin and shame?
For guiltless, thou thy life didst give,
That sinful erring man might live.

The realms of woe are forced by thee,
Its captives from their chains set free;
And thou, amid thy ransomed train,
At God’s right hand dost victor reign.

Let mercy sweet with thee prevail,
To cure the wounds we now bewail;
Oh, bless us with thy holy sight,
And fill us with eternal light.

Our guide, our way to heavenly rest,
Be thou the aim of every breast;
Be thou the soother of our tears,
Our sweet reward above the spheres. Amen.
