O blessed Saint, of snow-white purity!
Dweller in wastes forlorn!
O mightiest of the Martyr host on high!
Greatest of Prophets born!

Of all the diadems that on the brows
Of Saints celestial shine,
Not one with brighter, purer, halo glows,
In Heaven’s high Court, than thine.

Oh! then on us a tender, pitying gaze
Cast from thy glory’s throne;
Straighten our crooked, smooth our rugged ways,
And break our hearts of stone.

So may the world’s Redeemer find us meet
To offer Him a place,
Where He may deign to set his sacred feet,
Coming with gifts of grace.

Praise in the Heav’ns to Thee, O First and Last,
The Trine eternal God!
Spare, Jesu, spare thy people, whom Thou hast
Redeem’d with thine own blood. Amen.
