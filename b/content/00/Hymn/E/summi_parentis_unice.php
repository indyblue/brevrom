Son of the Highest! deign to cast
On us a pitying eye;
Thou, who repentant Magdalene
Didst call to endless joy.

Again the royal treasury
Receives its long-lost coin;
The gem is found, and, cleansed of mire,
Doth all the stars outshine.

O Jesu! balm of every wound!
The sinner’s only stay!
Wash Thou in Magdalene’s pure tears
Our guilty spots away.

Mother of God! the sons of Eve
Weeping thine aid implore:
Oh! land us from the storms of life,
Safe on th’ eternal shore.

Glory, for graces manifold,
To the one only Lord;
Whose mercy doth our souls forgive,
Whose bounty doth reward. Amen.
