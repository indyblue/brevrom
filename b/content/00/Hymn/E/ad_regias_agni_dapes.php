Now at the Lamb’s high royal feast
In robes of saintly white we sing,
Through the Red Sea in safety brought
By Jesus our immortal King.

O depth of love! for us He drains
The chalice of his agony;
For us a Victim on the Cross
He meekly lays Him down to die.

And as the avenging Angel pass’d
Of old the blood-besprinkled door;
As the cleft sea a passage gave,
Then closed to whelm th’ Egyptians o’er:

So Chrise, our Paschal Sacrifice,
Has brought us safe all perils through;
While for unleaven’d bread He asks
But heart sincere and purpose true.

Hail, purest Victim Heav’n could find,
Powers of hell to overthrow!
Who didst the bonds of Death unbind;
Who dost the prize of Life bestow.

Hail, victor Christ! hail risen King
To Thee alone belongs the crown;
Who hast the heavenly gates unbarr’d,
And cast the Prince of darkness down.

O Jesu! from the death of sin
Keep us, we pray; so shalt Thou be
The everlasting Paschal joy
Of all the souls new-born in Thee.

To God the Father, with the Son
Who from the grave immortal rose,
And Thee, O Paraclete, be praise,
While age on endless ages flows. Amen.
