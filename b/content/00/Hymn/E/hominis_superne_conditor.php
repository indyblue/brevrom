Fr. E.Caswall


Maker of men! who First and sole,
All things in wisdom ordering,
Didst from the teeming earth bring forth
Wild beasts, and every creeping thing:

At whose command, instinct with life,
Huge forms emerged from shapeless clay;
Ordainâ€™d through their appointed times,
Man, thy frail servant, to obey:

Expel from us wild passions, Lord,
With all the reptile brood of sin;
Nor suffer vice, familiar grown,
To make itself a home within.

Hereafter grant thine endless joys;
Here thy continual grace supply;
Unweave the guilty web of strife;
Draw close the bonds of unity.

Father of mercies! hear our cry;
Hear us, O sole-begotten Son!
Who, with the Holy Ghost most high,
Reignest while endless ages run. Amen.
