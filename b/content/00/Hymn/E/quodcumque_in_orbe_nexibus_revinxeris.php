Fr. E.Caswall


Peter, whatever thou shalt bind on earth,
The same is bound above the starry sky;
What here thy delegated power doth loose,
Is loos’d in Heaven’s supremest court on high;
To judgment shalt thou come, when the world’s end is nigh.

Praise to the Father through all ages be;
Praise to the consubstantial sovereign Son,
And Holy Ghost, One glorious Trinity;
To whom all majesty and might belong;
So sing we now, and such be our eternal song. Amen.
