O Queen of all the Virgin choir!
Enthroned above the starry sky!
Who with thy bosom’s milk didst feed
Thy own Creator Lord most high.

What man had lost in hapless Eve,
Thy sacred womb to man restores;
Thou to the wretched here beneath
Hast open’d Heaven’s eternal doors.

Hail, O refulgent Hall of light!
Hail, Gate august of Heaven’s high King!
Through Thee redeem’d to endless life,
Thy praise let all the nations sing.

O Jesu! born of Virgin bright,
Immortal glory be to Thee;
Praise to the Father infinite,
And Holy Ghost eternally. Amen.
