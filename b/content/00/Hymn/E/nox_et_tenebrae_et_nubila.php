Rev. W.J.Courthope


Day is breaking, dawn is bright:
Hence, vain shadows of the night!
Mists that dim our mortal sight,
Christ is come! Depart!

Darkness routed lifts her wings
As the radiance upwards springs:
Through the world of wakened things
Life and color dart.

Thee, O Christ, alone we know,
Singing even in our woe,
With pure hearts to Thee we go:
On our senses shine!

In Thy beams be purged away
All that leads our thoughts astray!
Through our spirits, King of day,
Pour Thy light divine!

Unto God the Father, Son,
Holy Spirit, Three in One,
One in Three, be glory done,
Now and evermore. Amen.
