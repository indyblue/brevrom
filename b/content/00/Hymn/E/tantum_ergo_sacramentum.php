Fr. E.Caswall


Down in adoration falling,
Lo! the sacred Host we hail;
Lo! oâ€™er ancient forms departing,
Newer rites of grace prevail;
Faith, for all defects supplying,
Where the feeble senses fail.

To the Everlasting Father,
And the Son who reigns on high,
With the Holy Ghost proceeding
Forth from Each eternally,
Be salvation, honour, blessing,
Might, and endless majesty. Amen.
