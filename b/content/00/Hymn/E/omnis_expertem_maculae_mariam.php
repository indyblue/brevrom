Dame A. Thomas, OSB, et al.


Lo! Mary is exempt from stain of sin,
Proclaims the Pontiff high;
And earth applauding celebrates with joy
Her triumph, far and nigh.

Unto a lowly timid maid she shows
Her form in beauty fair,
And the Immaculate Conception truth
Her sacred lips declare.

O honoured cave, by Mary’s smile adorned!
O hallow’d rock, whence spring
The living waters of a gushing stream,
The gifts of life to bring.

And thither from the farmost bounds of earth
The pilgrims wend their way,
And suppliant around the Virgin’s shrine
Her powerful help they pray.

The sufferers’ cry the Mother fondly hears,
And grants the longed-for grace;
And health restored, the pilgrim throng returns
Unto its native place.

O Virgin! have compassion on our needs,
Refresh us labouring on;
Obtain for us the joys of heavenly life,
When sorrow all is gone.

All praise and honour to the Father be,
And to his only Son,
And to the Spirit, Pow’r of both for aye,
In Godhead ever One. Amen.
