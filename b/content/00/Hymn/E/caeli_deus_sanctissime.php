Fr. E.Caswall


Lord of eternal purity!
Who dost the world with light adorn,
And paint the fields of azure sky
With lovely hues of eve and morn:

Who didst command the sun to light
His fiery wheel’s effulgent blaze;
Didst set the moon her circuit bright;
The stars their ever-winding maze:

That, each within its order’d sphere,
They might divide the night from day;
And of the seasons, through the year,
The well-remember’d signs display:

Scatter our night, eternal God,
And kindle thy pure beam within;
Free us from guilt’s oppressive load,
And break the deadly bonds of sin.

Father of mercies! hear our cry;
Hear us, O sole-begotten Son!
Who, with the Holy Ghost most high,
Reignest while endless ages run. Amen.
