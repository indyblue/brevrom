Christ’s flag unfurled in glory raised,
Triumphing o’er the serpent’s stings;
Come humbly forward all ye lands,
Applauding the great King of kings.

No force or threat doth he need use,
Not by coersion leadeth he;
Raised on the cross he draweth all,
With love unto his fruitful tree.

O! Thrice blest city of the Lord,
Wherein Christ ruleth without dearth;
Fervently she doth execute
His heavenly edicts to the earth,

No fiery weapon can e’er harm,
The peace ’stablished by Jesus’ hand;
In happiness and unity,
The ranks of Christ secure do stand.

A marriage blessed by faith in thee,
Yields virtuous offspring from the womb;
Like seed in fertile soil doth grow,
In virtuous homes do children bloom.

We yearn and long to shine on us,
Thy light, O sweet and winsome King;
All thus submitted to thy reign,
To us, thy gift of peace do bring.

O Jesu! King of all the world,
Honour and glory be to thee;
With Father and with Paraclete,
Glory through all eternity. Amen.
