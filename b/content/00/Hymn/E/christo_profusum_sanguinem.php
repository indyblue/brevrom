The Martyrs' triumphs let us sing,
Whose blood was poured for Christ the King;
And while due hymns of praise we pray,
Our thankful hearts cast grief away.

The terrors of the world despised,
The body's torments lightly prized,
By one brief space of death and pain
Life everlasting they obtain.

To flames the Martyr-Saints are haled,
By teeth of savage beasts assailed;
Against them, armed with ruthless brand
And hooks of steel, the torturers stand.

The mangled frame is tortured sore,
The holy life-drops freshly pour;
They stand unmoved amidst the strife,
By grace of everlasting life.

Redeemer, hear us of thy love,
That with the Martyr-host above,
Hereafter, of thine endless grace,
Thy servants also may have place. Amen.
