O cruel Herod! why thus fear
Thy King and God, who comes below?
No earthly crown comes He to take,
Who heavenly kingdoms doth bestcw.

The wiser Magi see the star,
And follow as it leads before;
By its pure ray they seek the Light,
And with their gifts that Light adore.

Behold at length the heavenly Lamb
Baptized in Jordan’s sacred flood;
There consecrating by his touch
Water to cleanse us in his blood.

But Cana saw her glorious Lord
Begin his miracles divine;
When water, reddening at his word,
Flow’d forth obedient in wine.

To Thee, O Jesu, who Thyself
Hast to the Gentile world display’d,
Praise, with the Father evermore,
And with the Holy Ghost, be paid. Amen.
