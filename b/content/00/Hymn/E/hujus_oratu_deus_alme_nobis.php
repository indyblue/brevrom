Fountain of mercy, hear the sweet petitions
Of thine own Blessed whom today we honour;
Cleanse our defilements, so that we may praise thee
Meetly in heaven.

Praise God the Father, and his Sole-Begotten,
Made of a Woman God incarnate ever,
With God the Spirit; Three in One co-equal
Throughout all ages. Amen.
