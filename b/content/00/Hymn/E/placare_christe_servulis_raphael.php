O Christ, thy guilty people spare!
Lo, kneeling at thy gracious throne,
Thy Virgin Mother pours her prayer,
Imploring pardon for her own.

O blest Archangel to us now sent,
God’s healing thou dost represent;
Defend our flesh from every ill;
With thoughts divine our minds do fill.

And ye, O ever blissful throng
Of heavenly spirits, guardians strong,
Our past and present ills dispel,
From future peril shield us well.

Drive from the flock, O Spirits blest!
The false and faithless race away;
That all within one fold may rest,
Secure beneath one shepherd’s sway.

To God the Father glory be,
And to his sole-begotten Son;
And glory, Holy Ghost, to Thee,
While everlasting ages run. Amen
