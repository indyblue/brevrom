Lord of immensity sublime!
Who, lest the waters should confound
Thy world, didst them in earliest time
Divide, and make the skies their bound;

Framing for some on earth below,
For others in the heavens a place;
That, tempered thus, the sunâ€™s hot glow
Might not thy beauteous works efface.

Upon our fainting souls distil
The grace of thy celestial dew;
Let no fresh snare to sin beguile,
No former sin revive anew.

Grant us the grace, for love of Thee,
To scorn all vanities below;
Faith, to detect each falsity;
And knowledge, Thee alone to know.

Father of mercies! hear our cry;
Hear us, O sole-begotten Son!
Who, with the Holy Ghost most high,
Reignest while endless ages run. Amen.
