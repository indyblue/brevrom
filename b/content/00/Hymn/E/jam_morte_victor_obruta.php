Dame A. Thomas, OSB, et al.


Now Christ, the conqueror of death,
Breaks sin’s enslaving chain,
And rising from the tomb returns,
And opens heaven again.

Awhile beheld by mortal men,
He rises from their sight;
Ascending to the Father’s throne,
He reigns in equal light.

His promised gift unto his own
He sends forth from above,
And rains the Holy Spirit down
In fiery tongues of love.

The Virgin, freed of mortal weight,
Is borne than stars yet higher,
And with glad melody is hailed
By each angelic choir.

Our Mother’s gentle brow now shines
With crown in starry sheen,
As nigh her Son, in Light enthroned,
She reigns creation’s Queen.

O Jesu, born of Virgin bright,
All glory be to thee,
With Father and with Paraclete,
Through all eternity. Amen.
