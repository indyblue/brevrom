Fr. E.Caswall


Lead us, great teacher Paul, in wisdom’s ways,
And lift our hearts with thine to heaven’s high throne;
Till faith beholds the clear meridian blaze,
And sunlight in the soul reigns charity alone.

Praise, blessing majesty, through endless days,
Be to the Trinity immortal given;
Who in pure Unity profoundly sways,
Eternally alike all things in earth and heav’n. Amen.
