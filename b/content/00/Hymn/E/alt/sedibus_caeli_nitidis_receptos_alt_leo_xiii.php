Pope Leo XIII


Sing, O ye Faithful, sing two Athletes, Brothers,
Received unto their brilliant thrones celestial;
Sing the two-fold strength and glory
Of the Sclavonic race.

One Love these Brethren did together bind in union sweet,
And one the tender pity that did them from their solitude urge forth;
They haste to bear to many, the pledge
Of blessed Life.

Bulgarians, Moravians, and Bohemians they fill with Light,
That beams resplendent in supernal temples;
To Peter, soon, these savage hordes they lead,
A numerous throng.

Your brow encircled by the well earned crown of merits,
Oh! do ye still continue to be ever moved by suppliantsâ€™ tears;
Needful indeed it is that ye protect your former gifts bestowed
Upon the Sclaves!

May the generous soil, that crieth unto you,
Preserve the pure brightness of eternal Faith:
Rome which first in the beginning gave, will ever give
Salvation to that land.

O Creator and Redeemer of the human race,
Who in thy goodness, givest us all good things,
To thee, be thanksgiving, to thee be glory
For ever and ever. Amen.
