Fr. E.Caswall


Dear Herald of our King! thou didst
Thy home in childhood leave;
Intending to barbaric lands
Christ or thy blood to give.

But thee a sweeter death awaits;
A nobler fate is thine;
Pierced with a thousand heavenly darts,
To die of love divine!

Victim of perfect charity!
Our souls with love inspire;
And save the nations of thy charge
From everlasting fire.

Praise to the Father, with the Son,
And Holy Spirit, be;
Praise to the blessed Three in One,
Through all eternity. Amen.
