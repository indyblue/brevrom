O glory and high boast
Of Poland’s ancient race!
True father of thy fatherland!
True minister of grace!

Twas thine the law of God
To preach, and to obey;
Oh, pray that we obedient be;
Nor from its precepts stray!

To th’ Apostolic shrines
A pilgrim oft wast thou;
Oh guide aright, through this dark night,
Our pilgrimage below!

Thou to Jerusalem
Didst go for love, and there
The traces of thy Lord adore,
And wash with many a tear:

O sacred wounds of Christ!
Deep in our hearts remain!
May we through you the promise true
Of life eternal gain!

To Heaven’s triunal Lord
Let the world’s fabric bend;
While evermore, from hearts renew’d,
New hymns of praise ascend. Amen.
