Son of a Virgin, Maker of thy Mother,
Thou, Rod and Blossom from a Stem unstain√®d,
Thou, King of Virgins, hearken as we honour
Virginal glories.

Lo, on thy handmaid fell a twofold blessing,
Who, in her body vanquishing the weakness,
In that same body, grace from heaven obtaining,
Bore the world witness.

We sing of courage which was never daunted,
By cruel bondage, nor by death through torture;
We sing of blood-shed which thou hast rewarded,
O King of Martyrs.

Fountain of mercy, hear the sweet petitions,
Of thine own Blessed whom today we honour;
Cleanse our defilements, so that we may praise thee
Meetly in heaven.

Praise God the Father, and his Sole-Begotten,
Made of a Woman God incarnate ever,
With God the Spirit; Three in One co-equal
Throughout all ages.  Amen.
