O Christ, the glory of the Angel worlds!
Of man the Maker and Redeemer blest!
Grant us one day to reach those bright abodes
And in thy glory rest.

And Raphael, Physician of the soul,—
Let him descend from his pure halls of light,
To heal our sicknesses, and guide for us
Each dubious course aright.

Thou too, fair virgin Daughter of the skies!
Mother of Light, and Queen of Peace! descend;
Bringing with thee the radiant Court of Heav’n,
To aid us and defend.

This grace on us bestow, O Father blest;
And thou, O Son by an eternal birth:
With Thee, from Both proceeding, Holy Ghost!
Whose glory fills the earth. Amen.
