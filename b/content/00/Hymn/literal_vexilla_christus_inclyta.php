Vexílla Christus ínclyta
Late triúmphans éxplicat:
Gentes adéste súpplices,
Regíque regum pláudite.

Christ, triumphing, 
unfurls his illustrious and extensive flag/standard
come suppliant nations
and applaud the king of kings

Non Ille regna cládibus:
Non vi metúque súbdidit
Alto levátus stípite,
Amóre traxit ómnia.

he does not reign by slaughter/devastation
and he does not subdue by strength/force
rather being lifted high on the cross
and by love, attracts/draws all people

O ter beáta cívitas
Cui rite Christus ímperat,
Quæ jussa pergit éxsequi
Edícta mundo cǽlitus!

o thrice blessed city
over which Christ rightly rules
which proceeds to carry out 
heavenly proclamations to the world

Non arma flagrant ímpia,
Pax usque firmat fœdera,
Arrídet et concórdia,
Tutus stat ordo cívicus.

not exciting/motivating by impious weapons/arms 
but rather by peace strengthening his covenant
and pleasing with harmony
the city's secure ranks who rest

Servat fides connúbia,
Juvénta pubet íntegra,
Pudíca florent límina
Domésticis virtútibus.

faith protects marriage
the youth grow up uninjured
the chaste members of the household flourish,
being illuminated by great virtues.

Optáta nobis spléndeat
Lux ista, Rex dulcíssime:
Te, pace adépta cándida,
Adóret orbis súbditus.

we who are chosen are radiant
(from) that light of yours, o sweet king
we, having gained innocence from thee by peace, now worship; 
the whole world having thus been subjected to thee

Jesu tibi sit glória,
Qui sceptra mundi témperas,
Cum Patre, et almo Spíritu,
In sempitérna sǽcula. Amen.

O Jesu! King of all the world,
Honour and glory be to thee;
With Father and with Paraclete,
Glory through all eternity. Amen.
