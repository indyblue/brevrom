O prima, Virgo, pródita
E Conditóris spíritu,
Prædestináta Altíssimi
Gestáre in alvo Fílium;

O principal, virgin who was brought forth
out of the Creator by the spirit
who was predestined by the Most High
to bear in her womb the Son;

Tu perpes hostis fémina
Prænuntiáta dǽmonis,
Oppléris una grátia
Intamináta orígine.

O woman, who was foretold 
the perpetual enemy of the demon
who alone was filled with grace
undefiled from conception

Tu ventre Vitam cóncipis,
Vitámque ab Adam pérditam,
Diæ litándæ Víctimæ
Carnem minístrans, íntegras.

Thou who conceives Life itself in thy womb
Life that was lost by Adam
The Radiant Victim who is to make atonement
Furnishes thy sound flesh.

Merces piáclo débita
Devícta mors te déserit,
Almíque consors Fílii
Ad astra ferris córpore.

Recompense for sin which is owed
death now departs, having been defeated by thee, 
And thou, co-heir of thy nursing Son
From the heavens did receive him in thy flesh.

Tanta corúscans glória,
Natúra cuncta extóllitur,
In te vocáta vérticem
Decóris omnis tángere.

Great glory which shines brightly
Thy perfect nature is extolled
in thou having been called from on high
Mankind approaches his proper state.

Ad nos, triúmphans, éxsules,
Regína, verte lúmina,
Cæli ut beátam pátriam,
Te, consequámur áuspice.

to us exiles, o triumphing one
o our queen direct the light
from heaven, our blessed homeland,
which we seek/pursue through our patroness

Jesu, tibi sit glória,
Qui natus es de Vírgine,
Cum Patre et almo Spíritu,
In sempitérna sǽcula. Amen.
