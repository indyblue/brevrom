Aspirations of St. Ignatius to the Most Holy Redeemer
Soul of Christ, sanctify me.
Body of Christ, save me.
Blood of Christ, inebriate me.
Water from the side of Christ, wash me.
Passion of Christ, comfort me.
O good Jesus, hear me.
Within Thy wounds hide me.
Suffer me not to be separated from Thee.
From the evil one defend me.
In the hour of my death call me.
And bid me to come to Thee,
That with Thy Saints I may praise Thee
Through endless ages of eternity. Amen.
