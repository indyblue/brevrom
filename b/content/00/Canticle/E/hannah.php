Cant Anna [Hannah] (I Kings [I Sam.] 2:1)
My heart hath rejoiced in the Lord, * and my horn is exalted in my God:
My mouth is enlarged over my enemies: * because I have joyed in thy salvation.
There is none holy as the Lord is: for there is no other beside thee, * and there is none strong like our God.
Do not multiply to speak lofty things, * boasting:
Let old matters depart from your mouth: for the Lord is a God of all knowledge, * and to him are thoughts prepared.
The bow of the mighty is overcome, * and the weak are girt with strength.
They that were full before have hired out themselves for bread: * and the hungry are filled,
So that the barren hath borne many: * and she that had many children is weakened.
The Lord killeth and maketh alive, * he bringeth down to hell and bringeth back again.
The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich, * he humbleth and he exalteth.
He raiseth up the needy from the dust, * and lifteth up the poor from the dunghill:
That he may sit with princes, * and hold the throne of glory.
For the poles of the earth are the Lordâ€™s, * and upon them he hath set the world.
He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness, * because no man shall prevail by his own strength.
The adversaries of the Lord shall fear him: * and upon them shall he thunder in the heavens.
The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth, and he shall give empire to his king, * and shall exalt the horn of his Christ.
