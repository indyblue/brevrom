Cant. Solomon (Wis. 11)
All things in measure, and number, * and weight, Thou hast ordered;
For great power always belonged to thee alone: * and who shall resist the strength of thy arm?
For the whole world before thee is as the least grain of the balance, * and as a drop of the morning dew, that falleth down upon the earth.
But thou hast mercy upon all, because thou canst do all things, * and overlookest the sins of men for the sake of repentance.
For thou lovest all things that are, â€  and hatest none of the things which thou hast made; * for thou didst not appoint, or make any thing hating it.
And how could any thing endure, if thou wouldst not? * or be preserved, if not called by thee.
But thou sparest all: * because they are thine, O Lord, who lovest souls.
