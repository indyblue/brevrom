I
<sr>From the Saturday before the first Sunday of Advent to 1 February inclusive:</s>
Mother of Christ, Hear thou thy peopleâ€™s cry,
Star of the deep and portal of the sky,
Mother of him who thee from nothing made,
Sinking we strive and call to thee for aid:
O by that joy which Gabriel brought to thee,
Thou Virgin first and last, let us thy mercy see.
