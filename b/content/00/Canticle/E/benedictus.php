Cant. Zacharias (Luke 1:68-79)
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; * because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people: 
And hath raised up an horn of salvation to us, * in the house of David his servant: 
As he spoke by the mouth of his holy Prophets, * who are from the beginning:
Salvation from our enemies, * and from the hand of all that hate us: 
To perform mercy to our fathers, * and to remember his holy testament, 
The oath, which he swore to Abraham our father, * that he would grant to us, 
That being delivered from the hand of our enemies, * we may serve him without fear, 
In holiness and justice before him, * all our days.
And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: * for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways: 
To give knowledge of salvation to his people, * unto the remission of their sins: 
Through the bowels of the mercy of our God, * in which the Orient from on high hath visited us: 
To enlighten them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: * to direct our feet into the way of peace.
