Cant. Solomon (Wis. 12)
O how good and sweet, O Lord, * is thy spirit in all things!
And therefore thou chastisest them that err, by little and little: † and admonishest them, and speakest to them, concerning the things wherein they offend: * that leaving their wickedness, they may believe in thee, O Lord.
Who shall say to thee: What hast thou done? * or who shall withstand thy judgment?
Or who shall come before thee to be a revenger of wicked men? * or who shall accuse thee, if the nations perish, which thou hast made?
For there is no other God but thou, who hast care of all; * that thou shouldst shew that thou dost not give judgment unjustly.
Neither shall king, nor tyrant * in thy sight inquire about them whom thou hast destroyed.
For so much then as thou art just, thou orderest all things justly; † thinking it not agreeable to thy power, * to condemn him who deserveth not to be punished.
For thy power is the beginning of justice: * and because thou art Lord of all, thou makest thyself gracious to all.
For thou shewest thy power, when men will not believe thee to be absolute in power, * and thou convincest the boldness of them that know thee not.
But thou being master of power, judgest with tranquillity; † and with great favour disposest of us: * for thy power is at hand when thou wilt.
