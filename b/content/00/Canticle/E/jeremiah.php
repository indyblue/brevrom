Cant. Jeremiah (31:10)
Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, * and declare it in the islands that are afar off,
And say: He that scattered Israel will gather him: * and he will keep him as the shepherd doth his flock.
For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, * and delivered him out of the hand of one that was mightier than he.
And they shall come, and shall give praise in mount Sion: * and they shall flow together to the good things of the Lord,
For the corn, and wine, and oil, * and the increase of cattle and herds,
And their soul shall be as a watered garden, * and they shall be hungry no more.
Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, * the young men and old men together:
And I will turn their mourning into joy, * and will comfort them, and make them joyful after their sorrow.
And I will fill the soul of the priests with fatness: * and my people shall be filled with my good things.
