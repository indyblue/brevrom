Cant. B.V.M. (Luke 1:46-55)
My soul â€ * doth magnify the Lord.
And my spirit hath rejoiced * in God my Saviour. 
Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid; * for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. 
Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me; * and holy is his name. 
And his mercy is from generation unto generations, * to them that fear him.
He hath shewed might in his arm: * he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart. 
He hath put down the mighty from their seat, * and hath exalted the humble. 
He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich he hath sent empty away. 
He hath received Israel his servant, * being mindful of his mercy: 
As he spoke to our fathers, * to Abraham and to his seed for ever.
