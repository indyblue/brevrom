Cant. David (I Par. [I Chron.] 29:10)
Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of Israel, our father * from eternity to eternity.
Thine, O Lord, is magnificence, and power, * and glory, and victory: 
And to thee is praise: * for all that is in heaven, and in earth, is thine: 
Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, * and thou art above all princes.
Thine are riches, and thine is glory, * thou hast dominion over all,
In thy hand is power and might: * in thy hand greatness, and the empire of all things.
Now therefore our God we give thanks to thee, * and we praise thy glorious name.
