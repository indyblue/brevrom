Cant. Moses (Deut. 32:1-18)
Hear, O ye heavens, the things I speak, * let the earth give ear to the words of my mouth. 
Let my doctrine gather as the rain, * let my speech distil as the dew, 
As a shower upon the herb, and as drops upon the grass. * Because I will invoke the name of the Lord: 
Give ye magnificence to our God. * The works of God are perfect, and all his ways are judgments: 
God is faithful and without any iniquity, he is just and right. * They have sinned against him, and are none of his children in their filth: 
They are a wicked and perverse generation. * Is this the return thou makest to the Lord, O foolish and senseless people? 
Is not he thy father, * that hath possessed thee, and made thee, and created thee? 
Remember the days of old, * think upon every generation: 
Ask thy father, and he will declare to thee: * thy elders and they will tell thee. 
When the Most High divided the nations: * when he separated the sons of Adam, 
He appointed the bounds of people * according to the number of the children of Israel. 
But the Lordâ€™s portion is his people: * Jacob the lot of his inheritance. 
He found him in a desert land, * in a place of horror, and of vast wilderness: 
He led him about, and taught him: * and he kept him as the apple of his eye.
As the eagle enticing her young to fly, * and hovering over them, 
He spread his wings, and hath taken him * and carried him on his shoulders. 
The Lord alone was his leader: * and there was no strange god with him. 
He set him upon high land: * that he might eat the fruits of the fields, 
That he might suck honey out of the rock, * and oil out of the hardest stone, 
Butter of the herd, and milk of the sheep * with the fat of lambs, and of the rams of the breed of Basan: 
And goats with the marrow of wheat, * and might drink the purest blood of the grape. 
The beloved grew fat, and kicked: * he grew fat, and thick and gross, 
He forsook God who made him, * and departed from God his saviour.
They provoked him by strange gods, * and stirred him up to anger, with their abominations. 
They sacrificed to devils and not to God: * to gods whom they knew not: 
That were newly come up, * whom their fathers worshipped not. 
Thou hast forsaken the God that beget thee, * and hast forgotten the Lord that created thee.
