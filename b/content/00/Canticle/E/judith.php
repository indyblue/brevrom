Cant Judith
~<t>Judith 16:15
Let us sing a hymn to the Lord, * let us sing a new hymn to our God.
O Adonai, Lord, great art thou, and glorious in thy power, * and no one can overcome thee.
Let all thy creatures serve thee: * because thou hast spoken, and they were made:
Thou didst send forth thy spirit, and they were created, * and there is no one that can resist thy voice.
The mountains shall be moved from the foundations with the waters: * the rocks shall melt as wax before thy face.
But they that fear thee, * shall be great with thee in all things.
Woe be to the nation that riseth up against my people: for the Lord almighty will take revenge on them, * in the day of judgment he will visit them.
For he will give fire, and worms into their flesh, * that they may burn, and may feel for ever.
