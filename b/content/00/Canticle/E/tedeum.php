Ambrosian Hymn
We praise thee, O God, * we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.
Thee, the Father everlasting, * all the earth doth worship.
To thee all the Angels, * to thee the Heavens, and all the Powers:
To thee the Cherubim and Seraphim * cry out without ceasing:
Holy,
Holy,
Holy, * Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full * of the majesty of thy glory.
Thee the glorious * choir of the Apostles,
Thee the admirable company * of the Prophets,
Thee the white-robed army of Martyrs * doth praise.
Thee the holy Church * throughout the world doth confess,
The Father * of incomprehensible majesty;
Thine adorable, true, * and only Son;
And the Holy Ghost * the Paraclete.
Thou, O Christ, * art the King of glory.
Thou art the everlasting Son * of the Father.
Thou, having taken upon thee to deliver man, * didst not disdain the Virginâ€™s womb.
Thou, having overcome the sting of death, * hast opened to believers the kingdom of heaven.
Thou sittest at the right hand of God, * in the glory of the Father.
Thou, we believe, * art the Judge to come.
<sr>The following verse is said kneeling</s>
We beseech thee, therefore, to help thy servants, * whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood.
Make them to be numbered with thy Saints * in glory everlasting.
Save thy people, O Lord, * and bless thine inheritance.
And govern them, * and exalt them forever.
Day by day * we bless thee;
And we praise thy name forever, * yea, forever and ever.
Vouchsafe, O Lord, this day, * to keep us without sin.
Have mercy on us, O Lord, * have mercy on us.
Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, * as we have trusted in thee.
In thee, O Lord, have I trusted: * let me not be confounded forever.
