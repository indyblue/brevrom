Te Deum
We praise thee, O God, * we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.
All the earth doth worship thee, * the Father everlasting.
To thee all Angels cry aloud, * the Heavens, and all the Powers therein.
To thee Cherubim and Seraphim * continually do cry.
Holy, Holy, Holy, * Lord God of Sabaoth;
Heaven and earth are full * of the Majesty of thy glory.
The glorious company of the Apostles * praise thee.
The goodly fellowship of the Prophets * praise thee.
The noble army of Martyrs * praise thee.
The holy Church throughout all the world * doth acknowledge thee;
The Father, * of an infinite Majesty.
Thine honourable, true, * and only Son;
Also the Holy Ghost, * the Comforter.
Thou art the King of Glory, * O Christ.
Thou art the everlasting * Son of the Father.
When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man, * thou didst not abhor the Virginâ€™s womb.
When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, * thou didst open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers.
Thou sittest at the right hand of God, * in the glory of the Father.
We believe that thou shalt come * to be our Judge.
We beseech thee, therefore, help thy servants, * whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious Blood.
Make them to be numbered with thy Saints, * in glory everlasting.
O Lord, save thy people, * and bless thine inheritance.
Govern them, * and exalt them forever.
Day by day * we bless thee;
And we praise thy name forever, * yea, forever and ever.
Vouchsafe, O Lord, this day * to keep us without sin.
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, * have mercy upon us.
Let thy mercy be upon us, O Lord, * as we have hoped in thee.
O Lord, in thee have I hoped, * let me not be confounded forever.
