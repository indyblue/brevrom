Cant. Simeonis (Luke 2:29-32)
Nunc † dimíttis servum tuum, Dómine, * secúndum verbum tuum in pace:
Quia vidérunt óculi mei * salutáre tuum,
Quod parásti * ante fáciem ómnium populórum,
Lumen ad revelatiónem Géntium, * et glóriam plebis tuæ Israël.
Glória Patri.

0~The holy old man Simeon intoned this canticle while he held in his arms the Infant Jesus whom the Blessed Virgin had brought into the Temple to present him to God.
1~Now, dost Thou let Thy servant depart in peace from this life, according to Thy promise.
2~“<l>Salutare tuum.</s>” The Saviour whom Thou hast sent.
3~Whom Thou hast set forth in the sight of all the people.
