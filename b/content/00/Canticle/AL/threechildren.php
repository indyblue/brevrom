0~A hymn sung at Babylon by the three young Israelites, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias, while they were in the midst of the fiery furnace wherein King Nabuchodonozor had condemned them to die for having refused to adore his statue (Dan. 3:57). This canticle, in which all creatures are invited to bless God, is very easy to understand. We therefore omit to explain it, because such an explanation instead of pleasing and instructing the reader would rather be wearisome to him.
