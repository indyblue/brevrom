0~Bp. Challenor: Tobias the father praiseth God, exhorting all Israel to do the same. Prophesieth the restoration and better state of Jerusalem. “And the angel said to them: Peace be to you, fear not. For when I was with you, I was there by the will of God: bless ye him, and sing praises to him. ... And when he had said these things, he was taken from their sight, and they could see him no more. Then they lying prostrate for three hours upon their face, blessed God: and rising up, they told all his wonderful works.—<l>Dixitque eis angelus: Pax vobis, nolite timere. Etenim cum essem vobiscum per voluntatem Dei: ipsum benedicite, et cantate illi. ... Et cum hæc dixisset ab aspectu eorum ablatus est, et ultra eum videre non potuerunt. Tunc prostrati per horas tres in faciem, benedixerunt Deum: et exsurgentes narraverunt omnia mirabilia eius.</s>” (Tob. 12:17-18,21-22)
