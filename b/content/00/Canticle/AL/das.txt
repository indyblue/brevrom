0~In this canticle we hear the prophet Zachary praising and thanking the Messias who comes to save mankind: he then shows his own son, St. John the Baptist, chosen to be the precursor of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2~“<l>Cornu salutis.</s>” The strength that saves, that is, the Saviour.
8~“<l>In sanctitate et justitia coram ipso.</s>” That is to say: Not merely with external worship, but also with piety and interior justice, which renders us likewise interiorly just in the sight of God.
9~Thou shalt be the prophet of the Lord; for before he manifests himself on earth, thou shalt go forth to prepare souls to follow his teaching.
11~“<l>Per viscera misericordiæ.</s>” That is: Through the immense and tender pity. “<l>Oriens.</s>” The word Oriens is not the participle of the verb <l>Orior,</s> but according to the Hebrew and the Greek text, is a noun substantive, which, as explained by St. Jerome, St. Cyril, and others cited by Tirinus in his comments on <si>Zachary,</s> 3:8, denotes the eternal Word begotten by God. Hence the following is the antiphon which the Church sings on the 21st of December in addressing our divine Saviour: <l>O Oriens, Splendor lucis æternæ, et Sol justitiæ! veni, et illumina sedentes in tenebris et umbra mortis</s>—O Orient, Splendor of eternal light, and Sun of justice, come and enlighten those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death.
12~“<l>Qui in tenebris et in umbra mortis sedent.</s>” That is: Those that are deprived of the grace of God, a privation which is the shadow of the eternal death. “<l>In viam pacis.</s>” In the path that conducts to eternal beatitude.
0~The title of this canticle sufficiently explains its contents, thus: <l>Scriptura Ezechiæ, regis Juda, cum ægrotasset, et convaluisset de infirmitate sua</s>—The writing of Ezechias, king of Juda, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness. In the first part Ezechias complains of his sad state, and in the second he thanks God for having restored him to health. This canticle perfectly applies to the Christian who bewails his spiritual infirmities and who then thanks the Lord for the help that he has given to him.
1~I said: In the middle of my life s course I shall enter the tomb.
2~I set myself to consider the rest of the years which I might have lived, and I said: So here on earth I shall not any more have the joy of going to the temple, there to visit and to adore my Lord and my God.
3~I shall see no more the inhabitants of my kingdom, who now live in peace.
4~Behold I remain deprived of all posterity, and my family will be destroyed, as is the wont to destroy a shed of shepherds. Such is the explanation of St. Jerome, St. Thomas, and others.
5~My life is being cut off like a web that is cut off by the weaver; I was still weaving it when the Lord cut it off; thus, my God, from morning till evening, Thou wilt make an end of me, that is, within the space of one day Thou wilt bring my life to a close.
6~I hoped to live until the morning of the second day; but the violence of the disease, like a lion, has broken all my bones, that is, has taken away all my strength.
7~My state is such that I cannot now last to see the evening. Like a little callow swallow that is in the nest, without feathers, suffering from cold and hunger, I cry out and beg for pity; and like a plaintive dove, so do I meditate upon my miseries, and implore for help by my moanings.
9~O Lord! I am oppressed by evil; do Thou answer for me. But what is it that I ask for, or what will the Lord reply to me since it is he himself who has done it, that is, it is he that has reduced me to the state in which I am?
10~This being so, I will go over in thought all my past years, in bitterness of soul for the sins that I have committed.
11~If this be man’s life, that is, a life of sin, and if thus my life has been passed, punish me, and thus preserve my life. Behold, in the time even of my great bitterness I have regained peace.
12~But Thou, O my God! hast delivered me from death; and in order to deliver me therefrom, Thou hast cast all my sins behind Thy back, no more to behold them.
13~He that is dead in the tomb can no longer praise Thee, nor can he hope to see the fulfilment of Thy promises.
14~Only the living sing Thy praises, as I am doing this day; and so fathers shall recount to their children Thy fidelity to the promises which Thou hast made to them.
15~Save me, and so I shall celebrate Thy glories in Thy temple all the days of my life. Bellarmine (Ps. 6:5) thinks, with St. Jerome and other Fathers, that Ezechias speaks here of eternal death and hell, as the preceding verse Eruisti animam, etc., would seem to indicate. The just soul, he adds, after the death of its body, is always alive and continues to praise God; and even without its body, in the tomb, it awaits the truth of God, who has promised to resuscitate it. We may see similar passages in the psalm 5:5; 87:11-13; 113:26, 27.—As we recite this canticle in the Office of the dead, it is then proper to apply it to the souls of the dead in the sense given by the holy Fathers; hence the House of the Lord, v. 15, can only be heaven.
0~Having learnt by revelation, of the captivity in Babylon in store for the Jews on account of their sins, the prophet prays for his unfortunate countrymen; then he announces their deliverance by Cyrus, king of Persia. According to St. Jerome, Theodoret, Theophylact, Rupert, Euthymius, Jansenius of Ghent, Cornelius a Lapide, and most of the other commentators, we have here a manifest figure of the divine work wrought by Jesus Christ to deliver mankind from the slavery of the devil.
1~“<l>Auditionem tuam.</s>” That is: All that Thou hast revealed to me.
2~“<l>Vivifica.</s>” According to Du Hamel: <l>Perfice</s>—Perfect. Lallemant gives this explanation: Complete Thy work, the deliverance of the Jews from the captivity of Babylon, and in mercy shorten the time of our chastisement. But this passage is better understood in the figurative sense, thus: Bring to perfection the work of man’s redemption by means of the Messias: Grant that it may have its full force and effect within the space of years which Thou hast determined.
3~In the midst of those years appointed; that is, anticipating the time fixed, Thou wilt make manifest the work of the deliverance of the Jews from the captivity of Babylon. (This is in the literal sense; but in the mystical sense is signified the redemption of mankind.) And though angry at the sons of men, yet Thou wilt be mindful of Thy mercy, and wilt not withhold it from us: <l>Licet peccatis hominum iratus,</s> says Du Hamel, <l>misericordiam tuam non subtrahes.</s>
4~God will come from the South to deliver his people, as the Holy One of Israel came of old on Sinai, appearing from Mount Pharan (Deut. 33:2). So too, from Persia and Media, lying to the South, came Cyrus and Darius to deliver the Jews from Babylon. In the figurative sense this verse, as understood by St. Jerome, Theodoret, Theophylact, and others cited by Tirinus, this verse applies to the Messias who was to be born at Bethlehem situated to the south of Jerusalem. “<l>Sanctus de monte Pharan.</s>” Tirinus says that hereby is meant the Holy Ghost, who descended on Mount Pharan and communicated the spirit of prophecy to the seventy judges of the people (Num. 11:25).
5~His glory overspread the heavens, causing their brightness to pale, and the whole earth was filled with their praises. In a figurative sense this signifies: The Messias who is to come will fill heaven with glory, and the angels will praise him on earth. It is thus that they chanted at his birth: <l>Gloria in altissimis Deo</s>—Glory to God in the highest (Luke 2:14).
6~He shall appear resplendent with light as the sun, and his hands shall be armed with power. “<l>Splendor ejus ut lux erit.</s>” This may mean, in the literal sense, that at the coming of Cyrus the light of liberty will shine forth for the Jews; and in the figurative sense that at the coming of the Messias, of whom Cyrus was a figure, the true light shall shine forth on the world, according to what is said in the Gospel: <l>Erat Lux vera, quæ illuminat omnem hominem</s>—That was the true light which enlighteneth every man (John 1:9). “<l>Cornua in manibus ejus.</s>” <l>Cornu</s> and <l>Cornua</s> in Scripture mean strength. Tirinus and Du Hamel, with St. Cyprian and St. Augustine, thus apply this passage to Jesus Christ: All his strength to conquer the devil and the world shall be in his hands pierced upon the cross. St. Augustine says: <l>Quid fortius manu hac, quæ mundum vicit, non ferro armata, sed transfixa?</s>—What is there stronger than that hand which conquered the world, not armed, but transfixed with iron? (In Ps. xxxiv. s. 1, n. 1.)
7~In the figurative sense: There (that is, in his pierced hands) is hidden his power; so that before his power, death will fly, conquered by his death: <l>Absorpta est mors in victoria</s>—Death is swallowed up in victory (1 Cor. 15:54).
8~At the entrance of the people into the Land of Promise the Lord was preceded by the devil, the executor of his vengeance; whereupon the enemies being vanquished, he distributed their lands to his people. “<l>Egredietur diabolus ante pedes ejus.</s>” This is explained figuratively: The devil shall be utterly vanquished, and shall go forth with shame, to be led in triumph before the feet of Jesus Christ, his conqueror, who will despoil him of his power, according to the words of St. Paul: <l>Exspolians principatus et potestates, traduxit confidenter, palam triumphans illos in semetipso</s>—Despoiling the principalities and powers, he hath exposed them confidently in open show, triumphing over them in himself (Col. 2:15). “<l>Stetit, et mensus est terram.</s>” Then Jesus as conqueror seated at the right hand of his Father, as Du Hamel says, and looking over the earth, divided it among his Apostles, that they might fill it with the light of the Gospel: <l>Qui, sedens ad dexteram Patris, terram Apostolis suis divisit, ut Evangelii luce eam complerent.</s>
9~With his looks he broke asunder the nations; and the great ones of the world, who seemed like mountains, were brought to naught. In the figurative sense: He looked upon the earth and the nations, and, giving them the light of faith, he set them free from the yoke of Satan; and as for the princes of the world, who as mountains were lifted up, they were brought low and shattered at the coming of Jesus Christ.
10~These proud hills of the world have been laid low beneath the feet of the Eternal. In the figurative sense: These princes of the world shall bow down before the Redeemer, bending the knee to adore him, as they consider that on him depends the course of eternal ages. “<l>Ab itineribus æternitatis ejus.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Itinera sæculi æterni ejus sunt</s>—His are the journeys of the eternal age.
11~I saw the tents of the Ethiopians cast down for their wickedness, and the tabernacles of the Madianites thrown to the earth. In the mystical sense: As the hosts of the Ethiopians and of the Madianites were seen destroyed on account of their wicked doings against God’s people, so shall those that oppose the Gospel be likewise punished.
13~Thou didst save Thy people, and didst deliver them from the Egyptians, mounting upon the clouds as on horses which draw the chariot.
14~Thou wilt resume Thy bow, that is, the bow of Thy power, and wilt fulfil the promises that Thou hast sworn to the tribes of Israel. Thus Tirinus, Du Hamel, and Rotigni explain it.
15~Thou didst cut in twain the course of the Jordan, that Thy people might pass over. Its waters saw Thee, that is, understood Thy command, and raising themselves like mountains, remained suspended in the air, as if grieving to see themselves stopped in their course; and thus Thy people crossed over the river.
16~The waters flowed back with noise, and in lifting themselves on high they seemed to raise up their hands to implore Thy permission to return again to their course.
17~At Josue’s voice, in the battle with the Amorrhites, Thou didst cause the sun and the moon to stand still in their course (Jos. 10:13); and didst make his army march by the glare of Thy lightnings, and by the glitterings of Thy spear from which thunderbolts flashed.
18~Thou didst tread underfoot, that is, Thou didst go through the earth with the roar of thunderings and of lightnings; and the hostile nations were astonished and in dismay at Thy wrath.
19~“<l>Cum Christo tuo.</s>” Such was Cyrus who came to set free the people from captivity, as Isaias had foretold: <l>Hæc dicit Dominus Christo meo Cyro, cujus apprehendi dexteram, ut subjiciam ante faciem ejus gentes</s>—Thus said the Lord to my anointed Cyrus, whose right hand I have taken hold of to subdue nations before his face (Is. 45:1). Now, Cyrus was a type of Jesus Christ, who has saved us by his merits, as remark St. Jerome, St. Augustine (De Civ. D. 1. 18, c. 32), and others. The verse is translated thus according to the sixth Greek version: <l>Egressus es ut salvares populum per Jesum Christum tuum.</s>
20~“<l>Percussisti caput de domo impii.</s>” Thou hast struck the head of the house of the impious one, that is, king Balthassar, the head of the Chaldeans, and Thou hast utterly ruined him (Dan. 5). In the mystical sense: Thou hast laid prostrate the devil, the head of impiety. “<l>Denudasti fundamentum ejus usque ad collum.</s>” Tirinus thus interprets this: <l>Denudatum evertisti ab imo sursum.</s> Thou hast despoiled him of his empire, and hast upset him from top to bottom, that is, Thou hast taken from him all his tyrannical power. It is thus, O Lord! that Thou hast willed to save Thy people by means of Jesus Christ.
21~Thou hast cursed his empire, that, namely, of king Balthassar, along with the head of his soldiers, who are come as a whirlwind to destroy Thy people. This is understood mystically of the curse pronounced on the devil, who held sway over the human race, and on his associates, who all contrived our ruin.
22~“<l>Qui devorat pauperem in abscondito.</s>” Who robs and kills a poor man in a secret place where no one can come to his help.
23~Thou didst open a passage in the Red Sea, making the horses of Thy people pass upon its muddy bed in the midst of the piled-up masses of waters. Tirinus observes that here the canticle ends, and that the prophet adds what follows.
24~The prophet, knowing by revelation what God’s people would have to suffer before their deliverance, says: I heard this prediction and my heart was troubled; at what was told me my lips quivered, so that I was unable to utter a word.
26~So that I may find myself at rest in the tomb on the day of so great a tribulation, and thus be united with our people who have already fought the fight against the enemy. But we read in the old Vulgate: <l>Ad populum peregrinationis meæ.</s> That is: To the people who regard this life as a pilgrimage, as I myself regard it.
27~In the mystical sense, this is what it may mean: In the desolation to which the Jews shall be brought in punishment for having put their Saviour to death, they will cease to produce any fruit of good works, having lost the kingdom of God, which shall be given to the Christian people who will bring forth fruits of holiness, according to the words of Jesus Christ: <l>Ideo dico vobis, quia auferetur a vobis regnum Dei, et dabitur genti facienti fructus ejus</s>—Therefore I say to you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a nation yielding the fruits thereof (Matt. 21:43).
28~“<l>Mentietur opus olivæ.</s>” The olive crop shall lie; that is, shall disappoint expectation.
29~St. Augustine (De Civ. D. l. 18, c. 32) applies this passage to the Jews, who after having put Jesus Christ to death, were to remain without pastors, without Temple, and without spiritual food.
30~“<l>In Deo, Jesu meo.</s>” In the Hebrew, according to Pagnini, Vatablus, and others, we have: <l>In Deo, salute mea.</s> But some, says Tirinus, interpret the Hebrew in the sense of the Septuagint, which agrees with the Chaldee and Syriac, namely: <l>In Deo, Jesu,</s> or <l>Salvatore,</s> or <l>Redemptore meo.</s> Thus St. Augustine and others understand it.
31~That is understood of the return of the Jews from the captivity of Babylon. In the mystical sense it is applied to the Gentiles hastening to come to God when set free by Jesus Christ from the bondage of Satan.
32~The vanquisher of enemies will lead me up to Mount Sion, there to sing his glories. In the spiritual sense, according to St. Jerome: He will bring me to heaven, there to glorify him with hymns of praise and thanksgiving.
0~Inspired by the Holy Ghost, Anna thanks God for having freed her from the reproach of sterility, and she predicts clearly the mystery of the Incarnation and the glories of the Church. There is no Christian that cannot use this canticle to thank God for all his benefits, and especially for the benefits of Redemption.
1~My heart has exulted with joy in the Lord; and my glory, as a mother, has been exalted by the power of my God.
2~My enemies insulted me; I was able to answer them that Thou hast consoled me by granting me the favor of delivering me from sterility.
5~“<l>Vetera.</s>” The Hebrew word, as Du Hamel remarks, also signifies: <l>Dura</s>—Hard. The explanation of this verse is: Let your hard and cutting words of the past cease; for God is the Lord of wisdom, and it is before him that all our thoughts should be prepared or directed.
8~“<l>Infirmata est.</s>” Has become weak, that is, sterile.
16~The Lord will judge the whole earth, and will give it over to be governed by the King of his choice, and he will exalt the glory of his Christ, that is, of the Messias.
0~Isaias, after having prophesied the coming of the Messias, the call of the Gentiles, the end of the captivity, and the return of the Jews to the Land of Promise, composed this canticle that it might be chanted by the people in thanksgiving to the Lord. (Is. 12) The Church appoints it to be sung as a thanksgiving to Jesus Christ for having given us the law of grace and for having by this signal benefit delivered us from the slavery of the devil.
1~I will ever thank Thee, because after being justly angry with me for my sins, Thy wrath is turned to clemency, and has consoled me.
2,3~My God has come himself to save me; I shall then live henceforward in confidence and without fear; for the Lord will be my strength and the object of my praise, since he has willed to become my Saviour.
4,5~The prophet here addresses his words to the faithful, and says to them: You will draw with joy from the very fountains of the Saviour the waters of salvation; that is, according to St. Cyril and St. Jerome, his holy doctrine; or, according to St. Ambrose and Origen, the sacraments; or, according to St. Bernard, the gifts of the Holy Ghost. And in that day you will say one to another: Give praise to the Lord, and invoke his name; make known to the people the inventions of his love, and remember always to praise him, for his name is exceedingly great, even high above all praise.
6~“<l>Quoniam magnifice fecit.</s>” For the magnificence that he has wrought in making us pass from death to life.
7~“<l>Habitatio Sion.</s>” The assembly of the faithful, the holy Church. “<l>Magnus in medio tui, Sanctus Israel.</s>” That is: Emmanuel, the expected of Israel, is in the midst of thee, to enrich thee with his graces.
0~The Most Blessed Virgin extols in this canticle the goodness of God for having chosen her to be his Mother, and for having redeemed the world by means of Jesus Christ. This canticle may be divided into three parts. In the first, the Blessed Virgin thanks the Lord for the favors that have been conferred upon her. In the second, she praises him for the benefits granted to the Hebrew people. In the third, she glorifies him for the grace that he has bestowed upon all men in giving them Jesus Christ for their Saviour.
1~“<l>Magnificat.</s>” That is, according to the Greek text: It extols the greatness of.
2~“<l>Salutari.</s>” According to the Hebrew and the Greek: <l>Jesu,</s> or <l>Salvatore.</s> The Blessed Virgin found all her delight in rejoicing in her God; and such also should be ours.
3~“<l>Humilitatem.</s>” According to the Greek: <l>Vilitatem, Abjectionem</s>—Meanness, Littleness, Lowliness. The most humble Mary could not mean by this word the virtue of humility, for if so she would be praising herself; whereas humility, says Euthymius, alone amongst the virtues does not know itself: <l>Sola inter virtutes humilitas seipsam ignorat.</s> “<l>Ecce enim ...</s>” For behold from this time forth all nations and all ages shall call me BLESSED. This prophecy has been perfectly verified; for there is not one among Catholics that does not in a special manner venerate this great Mother of God.
4~Because the Almighty, whose name is holy, has wrought great and marvellous things in me, making me Virgin and Mother of my Creator.
5~“<l>Timentibus eum.</s>” Extends itself to all those that fear him with a filial fear.
6~God has shown forth his power by putting to rout the proud, that is, the haughty princes of the earth (we may also here understand the rebel angels), and he has defeated all their wicked designs whereby they sought to oppress the innocent.
7~“<l>Potentes.</s>” These proud princes.
9,10~He has taken under his protection Israel, his servant, that is, his chosen people, being mindful of the promise which, in his mercy, he had made to him, to send the Messias to redeem him, as he promised to our fathers, especially to Abraham, and to all his descendants.
0~Moses composed this canticle that the people might chant it in thanksgiving for the miraculous passage of the Red Sea. He predicts in it the conquest by the Israelites of the promised land through the defeat of their enemies.
1~“<l>Æquum et ascensorem.</s>” The horses and riders who pursued us.
2~The Lord is our strength and the object of our praise; he has made himself our Saviour.
3~He is my God, the God of our father Abraham; I will always proclaim his glory.
4~“<l>Quasi vir pugnator.</s>” He has come forth as a warrior to defend us.
7~“<l>Congregatæ sunt aquæ.</s>” The waters have gathered together, that is, have risen up on both sides to give passage to Thy servants.
9~“<l>Implebitur anima mea.</s>” I shall be fully satisfied.
11~“<l>Flavit spiritus tuus.</s>” The wind sent by Thee blew waves.
12~Who among the mighty can be found like unto Thee who art so great in holiness, so terrible in power, and so worthy of all praise for Thy goodness? And who can work the admirable marvels that Thou hast made.
13~“<l>Devoravit eos terra.</s>” Lallemant translates: Our enemies have disappeared from the face of the earth. But the explanation that Rotigni gives seems to be better, namely: The sea having cast them on the shore, they were covered by the sand. “<l>Quem redemisti.</s>” Whom Thou hast delivered from the hands of their enemies.
14~From the beginning of this verse to the end of the canticle, Moses speaks of the entrance and establishment of the people in the Land of Promise.
15~The people of that land rose up enraged against Thy people; the Philistines had the grief of seeing themselves driven out from the country where they dwelt.
18~Lallemant applies this verse to the passage of the Red Sea; but Rotigni applies it to the entrance of the people into the Land of Promise, spoken of in the following verse. Notwithstanding this reason, the first explanation seems to me more proper. “<l>Quem possedisti.</s>” This people whom Thou hast won for Thyself, and hast made Thy own possession.
19~Thou wilt bring in this Thy people, and wilt establish them on Mount Sion, which Thou hast chosen for Thy inheritance and for Thy fixed abode, having prepared it in order to found there Thy temple.
20~This sanctuary, which Thou, O Lord! hast established to make there Thy perpetual abode, will serve for Thee to reign in throughout the ages and world without end. Here the canticle finishes: what follows is a summary of the history of the passage of the Red Sea, as recorded in Exodus.
0~It is by God s order that Moses, just before his death, intones this canticle in the presence of the people. In it he recounts the benefits done to the Israelites, the faults, and the chastisements sent by God to convert them (Deut. 32).
2~“<l>Concrescat.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Stillet.</s> “<l>Fluat ut ros eloquium meum.</s>” Let my speech drop down as dew into the minds of those that hear me.
3~“<l>Nomen Domini invocabo.</s>” I will invoke the name of the Lord, that my words may be of profit.
5~God is faithful to his promises, and in him there is no iniquity, for he is just and righteous; but for all that, the Israelites have turned their back upon him, and by their shameful action have made themselves unworthy to be called his children.
7~“<l>Possedit te.</s>” That is: Has chosen thee out of all nations for his own property.
9~Ask of your fathers, and they will recount to you what they have seen; question your elders, and hear what they will tell you.
11~He fixed the boundaries of the people who were to be the first to dwell in the Land of Promise, according to the number of the children of Israel who should possess that land.
12~For the portion which the Lord reserved to himself, as specially his own, was the people of his choice; he thus destined Jacob to be his inheritance. In Scripture the portion of inheritance is called <l>Funiculus,</s> a line, because the portions were marked out by a line of cord.
14~“<l>Docuit.</s>” He instructed him in his law.
19~That is: That he might draw honey even from the rocks, where the bees made their combs, and gather oil from the olives planted amongst the rocks.
20~“<l>Cum adipe agnorum et arietum.</s>” That is: With the flesh of the fat lambs and sheep; for it was forbidden to the Israelites to eat the fat of these animals (Levit. 7:23). “<l>Filiorum Basan.</s>” That is: The country of Basan, east of the Jordan, were there were excellent pasturages, and therefore the best flocks.
22,23~This people, so beloved by God, after being thus fattened on his gifts, became stubborn: they struck out their heels against him by disobeying his precepts; in fine, having grown fat, and big, and bloated, they forsook their God who created them, and separated themselves from that God who alone could save them.
24~“<l>Provocaverunt eum.</s>” These ungrateful ones provoked him to anger.
26~They brought into the world certain new gods, unknown to their fathers.
27~Apostrophe to these foolish people.
0~The holy old man Simeon intoned this canticle while he held in his arms the Infant Jesus whom the Blessed Virgin had brought into the Temple to present him to God.
1~Now, dost Thou let Thy servant depart in peace from this life, according to Thy promise.
2~“<l>Salutare tuum.</s>” The Saviour whom Thou hast sent.
3~Whom Thou hast set forth in the sight of all the people.
0~A hymn sung at Babylon by the three young Israelites, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias, while they were in the midst of the fiery furnace wherein King Nabuchodonozor had condemned them to die for having refused to adore his statue (Dan. 3:57). This canticle, in which all creatures are invited to bless God, is very easy to understand. We therefore omit to explain it, because such an explanation instead of pleasing and instructing the reader would rather be wearisome to him.
