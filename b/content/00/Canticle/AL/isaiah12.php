0~Isaias, after having prophesied the coming of the Messias, the call of the Gentiles, the end of the captivity, and the return of the Jews to the Land of Promise, composed this canticle that it might be chanted by the people in thanksgiving to the Lord. (Is. 12) The Church appoints it to be sung as a thanksgiving to Jesus Christ for having given us the law of grace and for having by this signal benefit delivered us from the slavery of the devil.
1~I will ever thank Thee, because after being justly angry with me for my sins, Thy wrath is turned to clemency, and has consoled me.
2,3~My God has come himself to save me; I shall then live henceforward in confidence and without fear; for the Lord will be my strength and the object of my praise, since he has willed to become my Saviour.
4,5~The prophet here addresses his words to the faithful, and says to them: You will draw with joy from the very fountains of the Saviour the waters of salvation; that is, according to St. Cyril and St. Jerome, his holy doctrine; or, according to St. Ambrose and Origen, the sacraments; or, according to St. Bernard, the gifts of the Holy Ghost. And in that day you will say one to another: Give praise to the Lord, and invoke his name; make known to the people the inventions of his love, and remember always to praise him, for his name is exceedingly great, even high above all praise.
6~“<l>Quoniam magnifice fecit.</s>” For the magnificence that he has wrought in making us pass from death to life.
7~“<l>Habitatio Sion.</s>” The assembly of the faithful, the holy Church. “<l>Magnus in medio tui, Sanctus Israel.</s>” That is: Emmanuel, the expected of Israel, is in the midst of thee, to enrich thee with his graces.
