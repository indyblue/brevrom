0~Moses composed this canticle that the people might chant it in thanksgiving for the miraculous passage of the Red Sea. He predicts in it the conquest by the Israelites of the promised land through the defeat of their enemies.
1~“<l>Æquum et ascensorem.</s>” The horses and riders who pursued us.
2~The Lord is our strength and the object of our praise; he has made himself our Saviour.

9~“<l>Implebitur anima mea.</s>” I shall be fully satisfied.
11~“<l>Flavit spiritus tuus.</s>” The wind sent by Thee blew waves.
12~Who among the mighty can be found like unto Thee who art so great in holiness, so terrible in power, and so worthy of all praise for Thy goodness? And who can work the admirable marvels that Thou hast made.

14~From the beginning of this verse to the end of the canticle, Moses speaks of the entrance and establishment of the people in the Land of Promise.
15~The people of that land rose up enraged against Thy people; the Philistines had the grief of seeing themselves driven out from the country where they dwelt.
18~Lallemant applies this verse to the passage of the Red Sea; but Rotigni applies it to the entrance of the people into the Land of Promise, spoken of in the following verse. Notwithstanding this reason, the first explanation seems to me more proper. “<l>Quem possedisti.</s>” This people whom Thou hast won for Thyself, and hast made Thy own possession.
19~Thou wilt bring in this Thy people, and wilt establish them on Mount Sion, which Thou hast chosen for Thy inheritance and for Thy fixed abode, having prepared it in order to found there Thy temple.
