0~Bp. Challenor: David by word and example encourageth the princes to contribute liberally to the building of the temple. His thanksgiving, prayer, and sacrifices: his death. “And the people rejoiced, when they promised their offerings willingly: because they offered them to the Lord with all their heart: and David the king rejoiced also with a great joy. And he blessed the Lord before all the multitude, and he said:—<l>Lætatusque est populus cum vota sponte promitterent: quia corde toto offerebant ea Domino: sed et David rex lætatus est gaudio magno. Et benedixit Domino coram universa multitudine et ait:</s>” (I Par. 29:9-10)
