II
<sr>From 2 February to Wednesday of Holy Week inclusive:</s>
Hail, O Queen of heaven enthroned.
Hail, by angels Mistress own’d.
Root of Jesse, gate of morn,
Whence the world’s true light was born:
Glorious Virgin, joy to thee,
Loveliest whom in heaven they see:
Fairest thou where all are fair,
Plead with Christ our sins to spare.
