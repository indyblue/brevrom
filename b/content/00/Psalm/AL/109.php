0~The reign of Jesus Christ, his eternal and temporal generation, his priesthood and his Passion, form the subject of this psalm. It is in the literal sense that we must understand it as referring to our Lord Jesus Christ; for he himself applies it to himself to convince the Jews that he is the true Son of God, as we read in the Gospel of St. Matthew, 22:44. In fact, after asking them how David can proclaim Christ his Lord, since Christ was to descend from him, David, he stated this irrefutable argument: If David calls him his Lord, how being his Lord could he be also his Son?—<l>Si ergo David vocat eum Dominum, quomodo filius ejus est?</s> (Matt. 22:45.) The Jews did not answer that the Messias could not be the Lord of David, as true God; but they would not allow that Jesus was the Messias or Christ of whom David had spoken. We Christians all believe that Jesus Christ was the true Messias. Thus are refuted the Arians who refuse to acknowledge Jesus Christ as the true Son of God, and true God as his Father. And in fact how can they speak thus since David proclaims as his Lord this same Jesus Christ as his Son?
1~“<l>Dixit Dominus Domino meo.</s>” That is: The eternal Father said to Jesus Christ. For “<l>Dominus Domino meo,</s>” the Hebrew reads: <l>Jehova Ladoni.</s> <l>Jehova</s> is a name that belongs to God only; it signifies HE WHO IS. The Hebrews through reverence did not pronounce the name of God. <l>Ladoni,</s> the dative of the word <l>Adoni,</s> means: To my Lord; the name that is applied to the Messias, not only as God, but also as man; and it is for this reason that David uses it here; for if he had designated Jesus Christ by the name of <l>Jehova,</s> he would have been understood as speaking of him as God only, and not as man. “<l>Sede a dextris meis.</s>” Be seated. “<l>Sede</s>” signifies supreme authority given to Jesus Christ as sitting at the right hand of God. “<l>A dextris meis.</s>” Equality of elevation. In reality Jesus Christ has the same dominion as his Father, not only as God, but as man, since his most sacred humanity has been raised to this exaltation by virtue of his hypostatic union with the Word, according to the words of St. Paul: <l>Qui, cum in forma Dei esset, non rapinam arbitratus est esse se æqualem Deo. ... Jesus Christus in gloria est Dei Patris</s>—Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. ... Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father (Phil. 2:6,11). There is no doubt that <l>In gloria Dei</s>—In the glory of God—is the same as <l>A dextris Dei</s>—At the right hand of God; that is: <l>In majestate Dei</s>—In the majesty of God. So St. Mark (16:19), speaking of our Saviour ascended into heaven, says: <l>Assumptus est in cælum, et sedet a dextris Dei</s>—He was taken into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God. St. Ambrose thus comments: <l>Audit quasi Homo, sedet quasi Dei filius</s>—He hears as man, he sits as the Son of God (De David, apol. 2).
2~That is: Thou shalt reign at my right hand, even during the time that Thou shalt subdue Thy enemies; according to what St. Paul writes: <l>Oportet autem illum regnare, donec ponat omnes inimicos sub pedibus ejus</s>—For he must reign until he hath put all his enemies under his feet (1 Cor. 15:25). The word <l>Donec</s> here signifies according to interpreters <si>As long as,</s> since, as Mattei says, <l>Donec</s> does not always imply the termination of what is spoken of.
3~Here David speaks to Jesus Christ, and says to him: The Lord, that is, Thy eternal Father, will cause to come forth from Sion, or from Jerusalem, the sceptre of Thy power, and Thy reign shall extend over the whole earth. This accords with the command given by the divine Master to his disciples to go to preach salvation to all nations beginning with Jerusalem: <l>Prædicari, in nomine ejus, pœnitentiam et remissionem peccatorum in omnes gentes, incipientibus ab Jerusalem</s>—That penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name, ... beginning at Jerusalem (Luke 24:4). Mattei observes that by “<l>Virgam</s>” many of the holy Fathers understand the cross, which is the sceptre of Jesus Christ.
4~There are in this verse several words difficult to understand: of these the interpreters give various explanations. “<l>Tecum principium.</s>” Some understand by “<l>Principium</s>” the divine Word himself, who is also the principle, according to the words of Jesus Christ: <l>Sicut tu, Pater, in me, et ego in te</s>—As Thou, Father, in Me, and I in Thee (John 17:21). But <l>Principium</s> is commonly explained as <l>Principatus;</s> Principality or Dominion, and this agrees with the rendering of the Septuagint. Thus Tertullian understands it, who writes: <l>Principium pro principatu sumetur</s> (Adv. Hermog. c. 9). “<l>In die virtutis tuæ.</s>” Mattei, according to the authority, as he says, of several holy Fathers, explains this of eternity: <l>Ab æterno.</s> But others, with great probability, apply it to the day of the last judgment, when Jesus Christ will display his power over all creatures; and this is the explanation of St. Augustine, Theodoret, Lallemant, and many others. “<l>In splendoribus sanctorum.</s>” That is: When the eternal Judge shall be surrounded by the saints, who will shine forth as so many suns. <l>Tunc justi fulgebunt sicut sol</s>—Then shall the just shine as the sun (Matt. 13:43). “<l>Ex utero ante luciferum genui te.</s>” This is to be understood, according to St. Thomas, of the eternal generation of the Word: I have begotten Thee before the star called Lucifer, that is, to put a part for the whole, before all creatures; and I have begotten Thee from my womb “<l>Ex utero,</s>” that is to say, from my substance, as St. Jerome explains: <l>De sua natura, substantia.</s> The sense, then, of the verse is this: My Son, Thy princedom over all created things shall appear when Thou shalt sit on Thy throne in the midst of the saints, who shall shine as stars or suns, to judge the world; for I have begotten Thee of my substance before the existence of the stars and of all other creatures, even from eternity.
5~The Lord has sworn, and will never repent of it; it is an oath and an immutable decree. He has said: Thou art priest eternal, according to the order of Melchisedech, in contradistinction to the priests according to the order of Aaron, who were subject to change and death. Jesus Christ is a Priest forever, because even in heaven he offers the merits of his Passion for the salvation of men who live on this earth; and even after the end of the world he will ever continue to offer them on behalf of men in thanksgiving for the graces bestowed upon them by God. There is also this difference between the sacrifices of the Old Law that in it animals were offered; while that of Melchisedech, in which bread and wine were offered, was a figure of the sacrifice of Mass, wherein Jesus Christ is the principal Sacrificer.
6~The Lord shall always be at Thy side, and in the day of his just vengeance he will overthrow the power of those kings who are Thy enemies. Here Mattei justly remarks that according to the Hebrew, instead of “<l>A dextris tuis,</s>” it is <l>Super dextera tua.</s> Hence these words mean here, not that Jesus Christ is to sit at the right hand of God, as some understand them, but that the eternal Father, “<l>Dominus,</s>” will give to Jesus Christ the strength to vanquish all his enemies.
7~Jesus Christ shall judge the rebellious nations, and will carry into effect the chastisements with which they have been threatened; he shall shiver in pieces on the earth the proud heads that rose up against him.
8~Mattei with Marcus Marinus gives this interpretation: He shall cause the blood of his enemies to flow like a torrent in which he will quench his thirst. But others give this explanation: Nevertheless this God made man shall first during his mortal life drink the water of the torrent, that is, the chalice of his Passion, which like a torrent of pains shall overwhelm him to death; but in consequence of this death, he shall lift up his head; for thereby he shall be exalted to a throne of glory, according to the words of the Apostle: <l>Videmus Jesum, propter passionem mortis, gloria et honore coronatum, ut, gratia Dei, pro omnibus gustaret mortem</s>—We see Jesus ... for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, ... that through the grace of God he might taste death for all (Heb. 2:9). Blessed death, which has restored life to all men!
