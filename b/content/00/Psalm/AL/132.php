1~How useful and sweet it is for brethren to dwell together in perfect union!
2,3~This union is like a perfumed ointment which, poured on the head of Aaron, flowed down by his beard even to the border of his vestment; it is also like the dew that falls down upon the mountains of Hermon and of Sion, and renders them so fertile.
