0~In this psalm, as well as in [Palms 148 and 149], all creatures are called upon to praise and thank the Lord for the victory gained over the enemies of his holy name. In an allegorical sense all Christians are invited to bless God for the victory that he helped them to gain over the devil, the world, and the flesh; a victory so great that for it they will be honored by being appointed judges at the day of judgment.
1~“<l>In sanctis ejus.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In sanctuario ejus</s>—In his sanctuary, which is principally heaven. “<l>In firmamento virtutis ejus.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>In fortitudine potentiæ ejus</s>—In the strength of his power. The almighty power of God shines forth in a special manner in the firmament, or in the heavens, as is the meaning of the word <l>Firmamentum</s> given in the first chapter of Genesis.
2~“<l>In virtutibus ejus.</s>” In the effects of his power, or in the marvels that he works.
4~“<l>Choro.</s>” Some think that this expression means here some musical instrument, now unknown to us; others that it signifies a concert of voices. We are ignorant as to what instruments correspond to those mentioned by the psalmist. Dom Calmet has treated this subject in a special dissertation.
