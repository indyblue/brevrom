0~This psalm is almost the repetition of the last seven verses of Psalm 39. According to most of the Latin interpreters it is the prayer that Jesus Christ was to make on the cross. It may serve as a model to the faithful in their prayers, especially when they find themselves in grave danger.
2~“<l>Qui quærunt animam meam.</s>” Those that seek to take my life.
4~“<l>Euge, euge.</s>” Well done, well done, we have struck him down. Instead of this word, St. Jerome translates: <l>Vah! vah!</s> a word, as Bossuet remarks, not of praise, but of mockery, just as people sometimes cry out in derision: Hurrah! hurrah!
5~“<l>Qui diligunt salutare tuum.</s>” Those that love the salvation that Thou hast promised. Or, as Bossuet explains: Those that wish to be saved by Thee.
