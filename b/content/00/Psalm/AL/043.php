0~What dominates in this psalm is the expression of the sentiments which should animate the just amid the afflictions of the present life. The psalmist, therefore, proposes to us a prayer that we should address to God in the time of tribulation.
3~Thy powerful arm scattered the idolatrous nations that dwelt in the land of promise, and there Thou didst establish our fathers.
5~But all was the work of Thy power, because Thou didst look upon them with a gracious eye, and Thou wast pleased to favor them.
6~“<l>Qui mandas salutes Jacob.</s>” Thou who providest for the salvation of Jacob, that is to say, of Thy people who descend from Jacob.
7~“<l>Inimicos nostros ventilabimus cornu.</s>” We shall scatter our enemies.
12~“<l>Avertisti nos retrorsum post inimicos nostros.</s>” Thou hast subjected us to our enemies, so that they have made us their prisoners, and we are forced to follow them.
14~Thou hast allowed Thy people to be sold for nothing; and there was none among the multitude who offered a price for the men of Thy people because they despised them as not worth buying.
20~“<l>Declinasti semitas nostras.</s>” It is generally thought that the negative participle <l>Non,</s> which is found in the first part of the verse, is wanting here. St. Jerome translates the passage thus: <l>Non declinaverunt semitæ nostræ.</s> Hence the meaning of it is: Thou hast not permitted our steps to wander from Thy way.
21~“<l>In loco afflictionis.</s>” To the depth of misery. St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>In locum draconum</s>—To a place of dragons, which means a place of horrors. “<l>Umbra mortis.</s>” The shadow of death, after which darkness alone remains; this denotes a great obscurity.
25~“<l>Quare obdormis?</s>” Why dost Thou make as though Thou sleepest, and takest no more care of us?
27~We see ourselves humbled and despised as the dust that is trodden under foot; hence, prostrate with our faces to the earth, we implore Thy mercy.
28~“<l>Redime nos propter nomen tuum.</s>” Deliver us from so many evils for the glory of Thy name.
