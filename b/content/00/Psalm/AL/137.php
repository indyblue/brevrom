0~In this psalm David thanks God for having heard his prayers and for delivering him from the hands of his enemies.
1~I will ever give thanks to Thee with my whole heart, because Thou hast graciously heard my prayers.
3~I will praise Thy mercy and Thy faithfulness to Thy promises, because Thou hast made known how great above everything else is Thy holy name.
4~Every time that I shall invoke Thee, hear me speedily by augmenting in me the strength that I need to be able always to serve Thee.
5~“<l>Audierunt omnia verba oris tui.</s>” They have been instructed in all the words that Thou hast said, and Thou hast brought them to pass.
6~Let them praise the ways pursued by the Lord; for very great is his glory in fulfilling all his divine counsels.
7~Let them say that the Lord is high above all, and yet that he does not disdain to look with gracious favor on things that are mean and low, that is, on the humble; while he knows from afar off the things that are lofty, that is, he holds himself aloof from the proud, and despises them.
8~If I find myself in the midst of tribulations, Thou wilt give me strength to bear them in peace; when my enemies advanced upon me in rage, Thou didst stretch forth Thy hand, and it saved me.
9~“<l>Domimis retribuet pro me.</s>” The Lord will avenge himself on those that persecute me.
