0~This psalm, taken in a literal sense, shows us David reproaching Doeg, the Edomite, for having excited against him and against the priest Achimelech the anger of Saul, and for having thus caused the ruin of many others (1 Kings 1:22). In the mystical sense, Doeg represents all the wicked that persecute the good.

5~“<l>Radicem tuam.</s>” He will make thee disappear with all thy race, as a tree is felled and pulled up with all its roots.
