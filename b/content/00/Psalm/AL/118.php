0~In the Hebrew text the first eight verses of this psalm begin each by the first letter of the alphabet, the eight following by the second, and so on with the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. This seems to have been done to help the memory. The learned say that this psalm is so long because it was composed with a view of giving pious and profitable occupation to the people who used to recite or chant it on their way three times a year when they visited the Temple. It is filled with praises of the divine law, with prayers for grace to observe it perfectly, with petitions for help in the dangers that beset us, whether on the part of men, or especially of the evil spirits who seek to destroy the life of our soul. In the divine Office the psalm is divided into eleven parts of sixteen verses each, distributed among the Little Hours, namely: Prime, Terce, Sext, and None. As the Little Hours are always the same, and have to be recited daily, it will be of much help when reciting them to give the attention of the mind to the petitions which the verses contain.

51~My enemies, proud of their power, have hitherto unjustly persecuted me, but I have never failed in the observance of Thy law.
52~We here remark that we should fear the judgments of God if we are unfaithful to him; but when we are faithful to him, with his help, which we shall certainly obtain if we are careful to ask it of him by prayer, the judgments of God should not terrify, but should rather console us; for these judgments are full of joy and comfort, because full of mercy, as David says in verse 39: <l>Judicia tua jucunda</s>—Thy judgments are pleasant.

69~The iniquity of the proud, who are properly the infernal spirits, is multiplied against me, to make me transgress Thy law; but I will ever study with all my heart to enter into the purposes of Thy holy will concerning me, that I may accomplish them.
70~“<l>Coagulatum est sicut lac.</s>” Is hardened like curdled milk.
71~“<l>Ut discam justificationes tuas.</s>” That I may learn how to keep Thy precepts.

83~“<l>Pruina.</s>” This word has given rise to different interpretations. Mattei thinks that it is put in place of <l>Fumo:</s> In the smoke; because the Hebrew word is thus rendered by St. Jerome in Genesis (19:28), and Emmanuel Sa explains it in the same sense according to the Chaldee: <l>Ad fumum.</s> So that the meaning of the passage would be: By reason of my sufferings I am become like a skin that has become shrivelled and blackened by the smoke. But others keeping to the Vulgate explain it thus: The sufferings that I have endured have made me become like a skin grown slack by the damp, and then is contracted and hardened by the frost; that is to say, have made me become tepid. Of these two interpretations the reader can choose the one that most approves itself to him. For my part, I prefer the second, because it is in conformity with the letter of the Vulgate and is the one most commonly received.
84~How many days must Thy servant remain thus tried? When wilt Thou pass judgment on my persecutors, and punish them as they deserve?
85~These wicked men have set before my eyes the goods of this world, which in truth are all deceitful fables when confronted with Thy law, which alone satisfies him who keeps it.

87~They had all but ruined me here on earth with their temptations; but with Thy help I have not ceased to obey Thy precepts.
89-92~These four verses are variously interpreted. The best and most suitable explanation appears to me to be that given by Mattei, with Bossuet and several others, according to which David means here to say: O Lord, the heavens obey Thee, by always remaining in the state wherein Thou hast placed them; in like manner the earth remains the same as when Thou didst first establish it; so, too, the day and all irrational creatures obey Thee. After this the psalmist concludes: if I had not obeyed Thee myself, by meditating and observing Thy law in the numerous persecutions that I have suffered, I should have perished through my weakness.
93~“<l>Vivificasti me.</s>” Thou hast preserved my life.
94~I belong to Thee, and I have given myself to Thee; Thou hast to save me, for I have tried to obey Thy ordinances.
95~Sinners watched their opportunity to strike me down; but I have taken care not to withdraw from Thy precepts.
96~I have seen that all things come to an end; but the law that Thou hast given us will endure forever. Thus Mattei and Bossuet explain this verse after Theodoret.

107~I have been everywhere afflicted and persecuted; do not fail to give me strength as Thou hast promised.
108~Graciously accept the free offerings of my mouth, and teach me to observe Thy law.
109~“<l>Anima mea in manibus meis.</s>” That is: My life is in danger. In the same way it is said of David: <l>Posuit animam suam in manu sua</s>—He put his life in his hand (1 Kings 19:5). The proper version, therefore, of this verse is: My life is always in danger, because I wish to keep Thy law; but I will never forget it.
111~I have chosen for my heritage to accomplish always Thy will, for it is the joy of my heart.
112~“<l>Propter retributionem.</s>” Mindful of the recompense that Thou hast promised to Thy faithful servants.
114~“<l>In verbum tuum supersperavi.</s>” In Thy promise I have put all my confidence.
115~Come not to disturb me; I wish to give myself to search into the precepts of my God, that I may observe them with exactness.
