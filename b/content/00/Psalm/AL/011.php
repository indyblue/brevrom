0~The confidence that we should have in the mercy of God and the fear that we should always have of his justice form the twofold subject of this psalm.
1~“<l>Defecit sanctus.</s>” Men, even those that are reputed holy, have failed in keeping Thy precepts. “<l>Diminutæ sunt veritates a filiis hominum.</s>” They are found to be liars.
2~One seeks to deceive one’s neighbor by telling him vain things that are nothing but knavish tricks; one speaks with a double heart when one thinks one thing and means another.
3~Prophetic imprecation: the psalmist threatens with divine vengeance these deceivers and these proud men who boast of merits that they do not possess.
4~“<l>Linguam nostrum magnificabimus.</s>” We will make ourselves esteemed by causing our tongues to prevail. This accords with the Hebrew, which is thus translated: <l>Lingua nostra vires addemus</s>—We will strengthen our tongue. “<l>Labia nostra a nobis sunt</s>”—We have our own mouth with which to defend ourselves. “<l>Quis noster dominus est?</s>”—Who is the master that will prevent us from speaking?
6~I will put the just into a place of safety; this I will do freely; no one will be able to resist me.
7~The words and the promises of the Lord are pure and sincere, free from all falsehood and all deceit; they are as silver tried by the fire in a crucible, and refined seven times, so that it is entirely purified from the earth or dross. “<l>Probatum terræ.</s>” St. Jerome translates this: <l>Separatum a terra.</s>
8~Thou wilt always preserve us from this race of proud and deceitful men.
9~The wicked surround the just that they may oppress them; and Thou, according to the depth of Thy judgments, permittest the wicked to increase in numbers, and to delight in the good things of this world.
