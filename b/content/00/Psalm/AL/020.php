0~Hymn of thanksgiving which the people address to God for the victories granted to the arms of David. According to Bellarmine, this psalm is understood in the spiritual sense of the victory which Jesus Christ gained through the merits of his Passion over sin and over hell.
1~“<l>Super salutare tuum.</s>” On account of the salvation that he has received from Thee.
2~“<l>Voluntate labiorum ejus non fraudasti eum.</s>” Thou hast not failed to hear his prayers.
6~“<l>Dabis eum in benedictionem.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Pones eum benedictiones</s>—Thou hast set him to be blessings. These words can be verified only in Jesus Christ, the eternal source of blessings, which all receive through him.
8~“<l>Inveniatur manus tua omnibus inimicis tuis.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Inveniet manus tua omnes inimicos tuos</s>—Thy hand shall find all Thy enemies.
9~“<l>In tempore vultus tui.</s>” When Thy angry face shall make them see Thy just wrath.
11~Most justly wilt Thou deal with them, since they have endeavored to heap evils upon Thee by the many outrages that they have done Thee.
12~This verse is very obscure, and has given rise to different interpretations. Theodoret and Euthymius explain it thus: “<l>Pones eos dorsum.</s>” Thou shalt put them to flight by making them turn their back. “<l>In reliquiis tuis.</s>” That is, in their posterity. “<l>Præparabis vultum.</s>” Thou wilt show Thy angry face. Bellarmine explains it thus: “<l>Pone eos dorsum</s>”—Thou shalt make them as though they were nothing but back, a part of the body exposed to the scourger. “<l>In reliquiis tuis præparabis vultum eorum.</s>” You will cause that their sight, for their greater punishment, be fixed in considering Thy elect, who are the remnant reserved and saved by Thee. Mattei, Menochius, Bossuet, and Tirinus take this whole verse all in one sense, and explain it thus: Thou wilt discharge Thy arrows so thick in their face that they will be forced to turn and take to flight. Let the reader choose whichever of these explanations he pleases; the last, however, agrees best with the Hebrew text, according to which, instead of the words “<l>In reliquiis tuis,</s>” it is <l>In nervis;</s> signifying the string of the bow on which the arrow is placed.
