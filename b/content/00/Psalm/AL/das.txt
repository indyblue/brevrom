0~The object that David proposes to himself in this psalm is to convince us that God bestows happiness only upon the just in order to be happy; we must, therefore, begin to be just.
1~“<l>In cathedra pestilentiæ non sedit.</s>” That is to say: Who does not teach false and pernicious doctrines.—Instead of the word <l>Pestilentiæ,</s> St. Jerome has <l>Derisorum,</s> which according to the proper Hebrew signification means scoffers, or impostors who teach falsehood. The Septuagint have understood the same expression in the sense of pests, or chair of pestilence. These renderings, however, come to much the same sense; for the impious, such as atheists and heretics, are, as is explained by St. Athanasius, St. Augustine, St. Basil, the pest of the world by the false and pernicious doctrines that they teach.
2~The just man wills what God ordains in his law; hence he continually meditates on it.
4~This tree will always preserve its leaves, which will help to ripen the fruit; thus will all the works of the just man prosper.
5~“<l>Pulvis.</s>” Pagnini translates the Hebrew word by <l>Gluma:</s> chaff, light straw or husks that are separated from the seed by threshing, winnowing, etc.
6~“<l>Non resurgent.</s>” That is, according to the Hebrew text: <l>Non stabunt, non subsistent</s>—they shall not stand, shall not keep their ground; and according to the Chaldee version: <l>Non justificabuntur</s>—they shall not be justified (Bossuet). This means that the wicked at the last judgment will not be able to oppose the just vengeance of Jesus Christ. St. Augustine explains this verse by saying that the wicked will not rise again to be judged because they are already condemned to punishment—<l>Non resurgent ut judicentur, quia jam pœnis destinati sunt.</s> We should, however, here remark that the expression <l>Non resurgent</s> does not mean that the wicked will not rise on the day of judgment; since we read in St. Matthew (25:31-4) that all men, just and sinners, must then rise; and this St. Paul expresses still more clearly in this passage: “We shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ—<l>Omnes enim stabimus ante tribunal Christi</s>” (Rom. 14:10). Moreover, the Apostle himself explains to us how we are to understand the expression, “<l>Non resurgent</s>” of the psalm, when he elsewhere says: “We shall all indeed rise again; but we shall not all be changed—<l>Omnes quidem resurgemus, sed non omnes immutabimur</s>” (1 Cor. 15:51). He wishes thereby to say that all men will rise again, but all will not obtain the happiness of having a spiritual and heavenly body, such as the just will receive, according to what he had written just before in verses 44-49: “It is sown a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body. ...Therefore, as we have borne the image of the earthy, let us also bear the image of the heavenly—<l>Seminatur corpus animale, surget corpus spirituale. ... Igitur, sicut portavimus imaginem terreni, portemus et imaginem caelestis.</s>” The words <l>Non resurgent,</s> thus understood, agree well with the Hebrew text and with the Chaldee version, so that the verses “The wicked shall not rise again in judgment, nor sinners in the council of the just,” may easily be explained in this sense: that the wicked, as the dust or fine chaff or light straw which the wind carries away, will be separated from the just, who are the good grain, according to what we read in the Gospel: “Gather up first the cockle ... to burn, but the wheat gather ye into my barn. The angels shall go out and shall separate the wicked from among the just—<l>Colligite primum zizania ... ad comburendum; triticum ante in congregate in horreum meum. Exibunt Angeli, et separabunt malos de medio justorum</s>” (Matt. 13:30,49).
7~<l>Novit.</s> That is to say, approves and blesses. <l>Peribit,</s> shall end in ruin.
0~This psalm taken in its literal sense is entirely a prophecy of the reign of Jesus Christ, as the Apostles themselves teach us in the fourth chapter of the Acts: “<l>Domine, ... qui, Spiritu Sancto, per os patris nostri David, pueri tui, dixisti: Quare fremuerunt gentes, et populi meditati sunt inania? Astiterunt reges terra, et principes convenerunt in unum, adversus Dominum, et adversus Christum ejus ...</s> Lord, who by the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of our father David, thy servant, hath said: Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people meditate vain things: The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes assembled together against the Lord, and against His Christ” (Acts 4:24). They then continue to speak of the conspiracies that were formed against Jesus Christ by Herod and Pilate in union with the Gentiles and the Jews. In fact, certain Protestant interpreters, and even some Catholic commentators, wish that this psalm should be understood, in a literal sense, of the reign of David. But D. Xavier Mattei wisely observes that this is a novel opinion, prevailing among Protestants, and worthy of our condemnation, since we should hold to the interpretation given by holy Scripture in the Acts of the Apostles; the more so since to apply this psalm to David we must do too great violence to the text, the expression of which so clearly refers to the reign of Jesus Christ. To which Xavier Mattei, conformably to the principles laid down in the preface of his work, adds that sometimes holy Scripture has for its literal sense only the spiritual sense, without supporting any other hidden sense. Consequently, he says, when according to the interpretation of the Apostles this psalm offers so evident a prophecy of the reign of Jesus Christ, what reason is there to apply it to the reign of David? “What rashness,” says St. Jerome, “to look for the sense of this psalm after St. Peter himself has given it to us! what boldness to dare to contradict what he says in the Acts of the Apostles!—<l>Audacia est hunc psalmum interpretari velle post Petrum; imo de eo sentire aliud quam in Actibus apostolorum dixerit Petrus.</s>” Bellarmine also says: “To seek in this psalm a literal sense applicable to David appears to me to be the height of error—<l>Omnino errare videntur qui ad litteram de Davide hunc psalmum explicare nituntur.</s>”
1~This verse predicts that it will be in vain that so many enemies conspire against the Messias. St. Jerome translates the words <l>Fremuerunt</s> and <l>Meditati sunt</s> in the future tense; but Bellarmine rightly says that here the version of the Vulgate, which agrees with the Septuagint, should be preferred; for in the Acts of the Apostles, as we have seen, the two verbs are in the past tense. The words “<l>Meditati sunt inania</s>—they have devised vain things,” are used, because these enemies while endeavoring to destroy the kingdom of Christ only cooperated in its establishment.
2~“<l>Reges ... et principes.</s>” By these kings and princes are meant not only Herod, Pilate, and the chief priests of the Jews, but also all the emperors and all the kings of the Gentiles who have persecuted the Church of Jesus Christ. “<l>Adversus Dominum, et adversus Christum ejus.</s>” The prophet intimates thereby that the enemies in persecuting Christ have also made war against God; for the Messias, by his miracles had proved that he was the Son of God. As to the first word of the verse, “<l>Astiterunt</s>” according to the sense of the Hebrew text, it is properly to be understood of the counsel that the Jews took among themselves to compass the arrest and the death of Jesus Christ.
3~David makes the enemies of God and of Christ speak here. They say: Let us free ourselves from their rule and their laws. “<l>Jugum.</s>” Instead <l>jugum ipsorum</s>—their yoke, St. Jerome has <l>laqueos eorum</s>—their snares. The wicked hate the laws of God; they regard them only as a yoke, and as insupportable chains.
4~David announces that God will dissipate and confound all the plots of his enemies, and will turn their designs to ridicule. This was accomplished by the destruction of idolatry, the dispersion of the Jews, and the conversion of the Gentiles to the faith.
5~God spoke to the wicked, and confounded them, not by words, but by the terrible punishments that he inflicted on them. “<l>In ira sua, et in furore suo</s>” We here observe that God never does anything in anger, as men do when they act through passion and with trouble of mind; for the Lord disposes and does everything with moderation and in tranquillity. “Thou judgest with tranquillity—<l>Cum tranquillitate judicas</s>” (Wisd. 12:18). Hence, when one reads in Scripture that God becomes angry, we are to understand that he chastises sinners, not to conduct them to eternal salvation, as he often does in regard to some whom he chastises in order to bring them to repentance, but only that he is chastising them solely to punish them, and to give free course to his justice.
6~“<l>Ego autem constitutus sum Rex ab eo super Sion, montem sanctum ejus.</s>” Here it is Jesus Christ that speaks; he will say to them: I have been made king, not by men, but by God, my Father, over his holy mountain of Sion; that is to say, over his Church, which, as St. Augustine says, was prefigured by the city of Jerusalem, of which Mount Sion was the principal part, and most beloved by God. “<l>Prædicans præceptum ejus.</s>” This means: I have been appointed king that I might publish his commandment. According to the Hebrew we here read: <l>Narrabo ad decretum</s>—I will declare for a decree. Substantially, the words <l>Præceptum</s> and <l>Decretum</s> signify the same thing; namely, the decree whereby God established the kingdom of Jesus Christ to be propagated throughout the world. The terms of the decree are as follows (see verse 7):
7~“<l>Filius meus es tu, ego hodie genui te.</s>” The literal sense of this word of the eternal Father, in the mind of the Holy Ghost, is threefold, as Cardinal Bellarmine and Menochius well remark. The first sense is that of the eternal generation of Jesus Christ as the Word and the eternal Son of God, according to what St. Paul writes: “Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they. For to which of the angels hath he said at any time: Thou art My Son, to-day have I begotten Thee?—<l>Tanto melior Angelis effectus, quanto differentius præ illis nomen hereditavit cum enim dixit aliquando Angelorum: Filius meus es tu, ego hodie genui te?</s>” (Heb. 1:4) Hence St. Augustine rightly says that this passage is to be understood literally of the eternal generation by which the Word was from all eternity begotten by the Father, in contradistinction to the angels who are the ministers of God created in time. We read the words: <l>Hodie genui te</s>—To-day have I begotten Thee; “<l>Hodie</s>”—To-day, because eternity is an actual duration, without beginning and without end, as St. Augustine well explains, speaking of this psalm: “In eternity nothing is either past or future, but only the present; because whatever is eternal, always is.—<l>In æternitate, nec præteritum quidquam est, nec futurum, sed præsens tantum; quia, quidquid æternum est, semper est.</s>” Bossuet (Suppl. in Ps. ii. 7) says that it would be difficult to find in the psalms a passage in which Jesus Christ is more expressly affirmed to be the true Son of God. The second literal sense refers to the resurrection of Jesus Christ, according to what we read in the Acts of the Apostles: “And we declare unto you that the promise which was made to our fathers, this same God hath fulfilled to our children, raising up Jesus again, as in the sacred psalm also is written: Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee.—<l>Et nos vobis annuntiamus eam quæ ad patres nostros repromissio facta est: Quoniam hanc Deus adimplevit filiis nostris, resuscitans Jesum, sicut et in Psalmo secundo scriptum est: Filius meus es tu, ego hodie genui te</s>” (Acts 13:32,33). The resurrection is, in fact, a certain regeneration, according to what we read in St. Matthew: “In the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit, etc.—<l>In regeneratione cum sederit Filius hominis</s>” etc. (Matt. 19:28) The third sense, also literal, has reference to the temporal generation of Jesus Christ according to the flesh. Such is the opinion of St. Cyprian (Testim. adv. Jud. l. 2. c 8), and of St. Fulgentius (Contra Arian. resp. 3); this is well confirmed by these words of the Apostle: “So Christ also did not glorify himself that he might be made a high-priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee.—<l>Sic et Christus non semetipsum clarificavit, ut Pontifex fieret; sed qui locutus est ad eum: Filius meus es tu, ego hodie genui te</s>” (Heb. 5:5). In the Introit of the first Mass of Christmas the Church applies the quoted words of this psalm to the mystery of the day. We here add that the holy Fathers understand these words of Isaias: “Who shall declare his generation?—<l>Generationem ejus quis enarrabit?</s>” (Is. 53:8), as referring not only to the divine generation, but also to the human generation of Jesus Christ.
8~The eternal Father continues: Since Thou art my Son by nature, it is just that Thou shouldst have dominion over all the nations and over the whole earth, as Thy inheritance and possession. St. Augustine understands this of the spiritual power that Jesus Christ has over the Church, which through his merits was to be spread through the entire world, according to what our Saviour has himself said: “All power is given to me in heaven and on earth—<l>Data est mihi omnis potestas in cælo et in terra</s>” (Matt. 28:18).
9~This is understood of the power that Jesus Christ has to reward the good and to punish the wicked as easily as the potter can break with a rod of iron his vessels of clay. The rod of iron signifies, moreover, the righteous and inflexible justice of Jesus Christ, which no one can resist.
10~That is to say: You, then, who are kings, and as such exercise the office of judges on earth, understand what is your duty, and learn to perform it well.
11~“<l>Exsultate ei cum tremore.</s>” St. Augustine thus comments on these words: “In rejoicing, that we give thanks; in trembling, lest we fall.—<l>In exsultatione, ut gratias agamus, in tremore, ne cadamus</s>” (In Ps. 1. n. 4). By the word <l>Timore,</s> according to the Hebrew, we understand the piety of the children towards their father; that is to say, that filial love with which kings and judges should serve God. The verse may therefore be thus explained: Serve the Lord with filial fear and with joy, hoping for reward if you observe justice, and fearing punishment if you do not observe it.
12~This verse signifies: Accept lovingly the law of God, and observe it, lest he be angry with you if you do not observe it, and lest he permit you to stray from the path of justice.
13~Unhappy those that wound justice and that are the cause why God becomes angry with them and hastens to punish them. Happy, on the contrary, are those that trust in God, because he will give them light and strength which they will need in order not to stray from the right path.
0~This psalm has for its title: <l>Psalmus David cum fugeret a facie Absalonis filii sui</s>—David flying before his son Absalom. It was therefore to David fleeing from the persecutions of the unfortunate Absalom that is commonly applied the literal sense of this psalm. But in the mystical sense, according to St. Jerome, St. Augustine, Bede, Theodoret, and others, David here represents Jesus Christ considered in his Passion and in his resurrection. We would here once more remark on the subject of the enemies from whom the royal prophet endured persecution, that all the psalms when they speak literally are to be understood mystically of all the internal and external enemies, especially of our most powerful and most dangerous enemies, I mean the devils who are plotting against our eternal salvation.
2~They tell me that there is no salvation for me, although I trust in my God. “<l>Ipsi ... Ejus.</s>” According to the Greek, these pronouns are masculine. Striking features of resemblance: David is betrayed by Achitophel, who ends by hanging himself (2 Kings 17:23); Jesus Christ is betrayed by Judas, who ends in the same way. David is persecuted by his own people; Jesus hears the Jews crying out to Pilate: “Away with him, away with him, crucify him. ... We have no king but Caesar.—<l>Tolle, crucifige eum. ... Non habemus regem, nisi Cæsarem</s>” (John 19:15). David hears these words: “There is no salvation for him in his God.—<l>Non est salus ipsi in Deo ejus</s>” Jesus hears these other words: “He trusteth in God; let him now deliver him if he will have him.—<l>Confidit in Deo; liberet nunc, si vult eum</s>” (Matt. 27:43).
3~“<l>Gloria mea, et exaltans caput meum.</s>” That is to say: Thou art the cause of my glory; it is Thou that consolest me: I walked with my head bowed down under the weight of sorrows, and Thou hast now enabled me to lift it up again with joy.
4~“<l>De monte sancto suo.</s>” That is, from his high heaven.
5~This verse means in the midst of persecution I took a tranquil and sweet repose; then I awoke and arose without disquietude, seeing that the Lord had taken me under his protection. These are words that mystically apply to Jesus Christ when he wished to be stretched on the cross and there give up his life, and then wished to rise again from the dead by the power of his divinity.
7~“<l>Percussisti omnes adversaries mihi sine causa.</s>” According to the Hebrew, we translate: <l>Percussisti omnes hostes meos in maxilla.</s> The Septuagint, however, have: <l>Sine causa.</s> Bellarmine thinks that the Septuagint have been able to translate thus, because the Hebrew text, which they used, was more correct than that which we have.
8~“<l>Domini est salus.</s>” According to the Hebrew, it is <l>Domino salus.</s> That is, salvation should be referred to God, and it is only from him that we should hope for it. Salvation is the blessing that the Lord gives to his servants; for to bless on the part of God means to do good.
0~According to interpreters this psalm was composed by David, happy to see himself delivered from the hands of Saul, or of Absalom. In a mystical sense it is applied to Jesus Christ inasmuch as he is the end of the law and of the prophets.
1~When I called upon my God, he heard me, he who is the defender of my innocence: Yea, Lord, when I was in tribulation, Thou didst enlarge my heart by Thy consolations.
2~Continue, then, to have pity on me, and hearken to my prayers whenever I have recourse to Thee.
3~“<l>Usquequo gravi corde?</s>” How long do you wish to have your heart thus heavy, that is, so bowed down to earth, and inclined to earthly passions? “<l>Vanitatem ... mendacium</s>” Vain and deceitful things, false goods.
4~Know that the Lord has made his holy one admirable, that is, me his servant, whom he has sanctified as King and Prophet; he will, therefore, continue to hearken to me whenever I shall have recourse to him in prayer.
5~If you become angry, take care not to commit sin, that is, be angry with a just anger, when the honor of God or your own duty require you to do so, and then do not be disturbed. St. Paul says: <l>Irascimini, et nolite peccare; sol non occidat super iracundiam vestram</s>—Be angry, and sin not. Let not the sun go down upon your anger (Eph. 4:26). And if your conscience reproaches you for having yielded to some fit of passion, then retire to your chambers at night, and ask God’s pardon with compunction. “<l>Compungimini.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Deum apud vos cogitate</s>—Think with yourselves on God.
6~Offer to God the sacrifice of justice, that is, of a just life, and put all your trust in the Lord. “<l>Quis ostendit nobis bona?</s>” Interpreters refer these words to the followers of David, who, seeing themselves persecuted with him, said: When shall we recover peace? According to Bellarmine, we can explain them in two ways either by supposing them as coming from the mouth of worldlings, who make but little account of heavenly goods, and say: Who has ever come back from the other world to tell us of these goods, which we do not see? Or else: What is this holiness, this justice, which you so much recommend to us? who will show us the way to acquire them?
7~“<l>Signatum est.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Eleva</s>—Lift up; or: <l>Elevatum est ut signum</s>—Is lifted up as a sign; which comes to the same thing. The sense, then, of the verse is: Thou hast shown us the light of Thy face, that is, Thy goodness, and thereby Thou hast rejoiced my heart.
8~That is: I behold my enemies multiplying with the good things that they enjoy.
9~But for me, confiding in Thy goodness, I shall continue to sleep and to repose in peace.
10~“<l>Singulariter.</s>” In a singular manner. According to the Greek: <l>Solitarie.</s> That is as much as to say: Thou takest care of me as if Thou hast none else than me to look after.
0~The just man may here understand perfectly how he should conduct himself in adversities and then be consoled by confiding in God. At the end, the psalm shows us the happiness of heaven as a reward promised to souls that suffer patiently here below.
1.2~God hears and understands everything; but sometimes he seems not to hear, or not to understand, because the prayer that we make to him is either not just or because it is ill-made. Hence David said: O Lord, hear me, understand me.
3~I will always have recourse to Thee; and I know of a certainty, according to Thy promises, that Thou wilt always hearken to my prayer.
4~I will place myself in Thy presence to pray to Thee, and I will always have before my eyes that Thou hatest all iniquity.
9~“<l>Propter inimicos meos, dirige in conspectu tuo viam meam.</s>” To confound my enemies so direct me that I may always walk in Thy presence.
11~An open sepulchre that exhales a malignant infection; for they use their tongues to weave deceits; judge them, and punish them as they deserve.
15~Thou hast surrounded us on all sides with the shield of goodwill which renders us secure from all the assaults of our enemies.
0~According to the most probable opinion of the learned, this psalm, taken in the literal sense, properly refers to the penitence of David. Hence it is, conclusively, the prayer of the sinner who fears the blows of the divine justice, and who strives to become reconciled with his God. It is the first of the Penitential Psalms.
1~This verse signifies: O Lord, punish me if Thou wilt, but not in Thy anger; that is to say: Chastise me as a father and not as a judge. Not to be punished here on earth after I have offended Thee would be to me the greatest punishment. I beg Thee, then, to punish me here below, in order that I may amend, and may avoid eternal death. (See what is said on this point in Ps. 2:5.)
2~“<l>Infirmus sum; sana me, Domine, quoniam conturbata sunt ossa mea</s>” Have pity on me, O Lord! I am full of infirmities; heal me by strengthening me with Thy grace; for my very bones are troubled, that is, are trembling with weakness.
3~That is to say: My soul also is troubled, and much more so than my body; how long wilt Thou delay to come to my assistance?
4~“<l>Eripe animam meam.</s>” Deliver my soul from the many miseries and perils that surround it. “<l>Salvum me fac propter misericordiam tuam</s>” Save me through Thy pure mercy; for I deserve nothing but punishment and hell itself.
5~“<l>In morte.</s>” In eternal death.
7~I have conceived great indignation against myself when considering the deformity of my sins, and when seeing myself growing old in the midst of my enemies, which are my vices and my bad habits.
8~“<l>Qui operamini iniquitatem.</s>” Perverse enemies, who would also pervert me.
0~Addressing himself to God, David represents to him his innocence and at the same time the anguish of his heart; this was at the time of the persecution that he had to endure from Saul or from Absalom—more probably from Saul. The holy king exhorts at the same time his enemies to be converted, and predicts to them the chastisement of heaven if they are not converted.
2~“<l>Animam meam.</s>” My soul, or my life.
3~“<l>Si feci istud.</s>” If I have done the wrong that is laid to my charge. This may mean that the enemies of David accused him of having wished to usurp the throne of Saul.
5~“<l>Conculcet in terra vitam meam.</s>” May he trample with his feet the earth stained with my blood in the place where he will take away my life.
6~This verse means: But if I am innocent, O Lord! show forth Thy just anger by punishing my enemies as they deserve. We should not here reproach David with having asked to be revenged upon his enemies; for we must understand him either as speaking in a prophetic manner, announcing the chastisements with which God would punish them, or as praying to God to send them temporal punishment that they may amend themselves.
7~“<l>In præcepto quod mandasti.</s>” That is to say: My God, arise in order to save innocence, according to the precept that Thou hast given to men to defend the innocent. “<l>Synagoga populorum.</s>” According to the Hebrew, <l>Congregatio tribuum:</s> The congregation of the tribes. That is to say: And then all the people shall gather around Thee, to praise the justice of Thy judgments.
8~“<l>Dominus judicat populos.</s>” It belongs to Thee, as the Lord of the universe, to judge the people.
10~The astuteness of sinners shall not avail them; for Thou who art God, and who knowest the secrets of their hearts, well knowest how to direct the just man, so that he may escape their snares. 
11~The Lord will not fail to give me his just help; for he saves those that act with an upright heart.
12~“<l>Justus, fortis, et patiens; numquid irascitur per singulos dies?</s>” It must be here observed that the Hebrew presents another sense, namely, <l>Justus et fortis, et comminans (irascens) tota die.</s> Hence, according to the present Hebrew text, we read that God threatens or is angry every day; in the Vulgate, on the contrary, it is said that God does not threaten and is not angry everyday. The version of the Septuagint agrees with the Vulgate, and with Bellarmine I prefer to adhere to it for the reason already given, namely, that it is believed that the Hebrew text of the time of the Septuagint was more correct than that which we now have; the more so since, as Bellarmine remarks, the sense as given in the Vulgate agrees better with the following verse.
13~This verse, united with the preceding one, signifies that God is not always angry and in the mind of punishing sinners as they deserve; but when they are obstinate and will not be converted, he will draw his sword and will punish them according to his justice; for this reason he always holds in readiness and has bent his bow to let fly the arrow of his just vengeance.
14~“<l>Vasa mortis.</s>” That is to say: The weapons that bring death. “<l>Sagittas suas ardentibus effecit.</s>” By this is meant thunderbolts; such is precisely the explanation given by St. Jerome: <l>Sagittas suas ad comburendum ignitas ejfecit:</s> He hath set his arrows on fire to burn.
15~“<l>Concepit dolorem, et peperit iniquitatem.</s>” The sinner first conceives grief in his heart, that is, hatred against the just man, called grief, because it afflicts the soul of him who cherishes it; then he gives birth to iniquity by seeking to oppress the person whom he hates (Job 15:35; Is. 59:4).
16~He has opened and dug a precipice, or a covered trap; but God has permitted that he should himself fall into it.
17~The evil that he wished to cause others shall descend upon himself.
18~Conclusion: As for myself, I will praise the justice of the Lord.
0~This psalm is a canticle composed in praise of the power, wisdom, and goodness of God, and especially of his goodness towards man. The multitude of the benefits received from God is therefore the subject of this psalm. Thus it is commonly understood by commentators. Nevertheless there are some who, on the authority of a passage of St. Paul (Heb. 2:9), apply it not without probability to the person of Jesus Christ.
2~“<l>Super cælos.</s>” Above the heavens, since the whole world cannot contain it.
3~“<l>Inimicum et ultorem.</s>” Satan Thy principal enemy, and the avenger of all Thy enemies. Some explain this verse, not according to the Vulgate, which has followed the Septuagint, but according to the Hebrew text, which instead of <l>Perfecisti laudem</s>—Thou hast perfected praise—signifies: <l>Fundasti fortitudinem</s>—Thou hast ordained strength. But be this as it may, we have translated it as is to be seen above: Even the very infants at the breast praise Thee perfectly, and confound Thy enemies. We must not depart from this interpretation, which is conformable to the Vulgate; for Jesus Christ himself rendered it authentic when after his entry into Jerusalem the children were heard to cry out: <l>Hosanna Filio David</s>—Hosanna to the Son of David! When the Pharisees murmured at this praise offered to our Lord, he said to them: “<l>Nunquam legistis, quia; Ex ore infantium et lactentium perfecisti laudem?</s>—Yea, have you never read: Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise?” (Matt. 21:16) We do not read the words: <l>Fundasti fortitudinem</s>—Thou hast ordained strength. Xavier Mattei justly observes that in all the passages of the psalter, or of any other book of the Old Testament, which are cited in the New Testament according to the version of the Septuagint, this version should be regarded as true and incontestable; and that if the Hebrew text differs from it, it should be corrected according to the Septuagint version. He adds that it is temerity to interpret such passages in a sense different from that given to them in the New Testament, excepting only certain passages that the Church has otherwise explained according to the Hebrew text, and that are susceptible of divers literal interpretations.
4,5~That is to say: When I consider the marvels that Thou hast wrought in favor of man, how can I refrain from praising Thee and from crying out: What is man, for whom Thou hast so great mindfulness, and whom Thou dost favor with Thy visit? This agrees with what is said in the Canticle of Zachary: “<l>Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel, quia visitavit, et fecit redemptionem plebis suæ</s>—Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people.” The Son of God comes himself to visit man, to take human flesh, and to redeem him from the slavery of the devil.
6-8~Although Thou hast given to man a nature little less than that of the angels, Thou hast nevertheless subjected to him all other creatures.
9~Repetition of the first verse for the conclusion.
0~Among the interpreters there are some that see in this psalm, when taken in the literal sense, David thanking God for having given him the victory over his enemy; and when taken in the spiritual sense, Jesus Christ accomplishing the work of the Redemption, and thus subduing the devil, the great enemy of the human race. Others, whose opinion does not lack probability, regard this psalm as the portrait of the unhappy end of the wicked, who have lived in prosperity, and of the glorious end of the just, who have been living in tribulation.
3~“<l>Infirmabuntur.</s>” My principal enemy having been conquered, all those that follow him will be weakened and thrown into consternation.
6~“<l>Inimici.</s>” This word, as Menochius and Mattei observe, is in the genitive; hence the phrase is thus construed: <l>Frameæ inimici defecerunt in finem</s>—The arms of the enemy have entirely failed.
7~“<l>Cum sonitu.</s>” According to Bossuet: <l>Cum ingente rerum gestarum fama</s>—With the mighty fame of their deeds.
8~“<l>In judicio.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Ad judicium.</s>
10~Therefore they that know and adore Thy name have great reason to trust in Thee, O Lord! because Thou hast never forsaken those that seek Thee in truth.
11~Praise the Lord who dwells in Sion, where he is adored as true God, differently from the idols that are found in the temples of the Gentiles; publish his works even among the most barbarous nations, that they too may praise him.
12~In examining the unjust deeds of men, he remembered the blood of the poor and their lamentations.
13~Here David turns to God in prayer.
14~“<l>De portis mortis.</s>” The perils of death. “<l>Filiæ Sion.</s>” That is to say, Jerusalem.
15~I will rejoice in the salvation that Thou hast given me, since my enemies have fallen into the abyss of death, which they had prepared for me. “<l>In interitu.</s>” According to the Hebrew, <l>In fovea,</s> to which the word <l>Infixa</s> corresponds; and this signifies, according to Menochius: They are fallen into the mire, from which it is very difficult further to extricate themselves.
16~“<l>Quem absconderunt.</s>” Which they had secretly laid to catch me.
17~The Lord shall make himself known as the great God that he is, by exercising his just vengeance upon his enemies, and causing the sinner to be caught in the same toils that his hands had laid for others.
18~Malvenda thus interprets this passage: “<l>Convertantur in infernum; quasi dicat: Male peribunt</s>—They shall be turned into hell; as if he said: They shall perish miserably.” According to Menochius by the word <l>Infernum</s> we must understand hell, properly so called, the place destined for the punishment of the wicked: “<l>Non enim sepulchrum tantum significatur hoc loco, nomine Inferni, sed etiam pœnarum locus</s>—By the word hell, in this passage, not only is meant the grave, but also the place of punishment.” This is also the opinion of Gordona. Hence this is the sense of the verse: Those that forget God during their life, will make a bad death, and will be sent to hell.
19~“<l>Non peribit in finem.</s>” The patience of the poor shall not utterly perish; that is, shall not always remain without recompense.
20~O Lord! show Thy power; let not sinful man prevail; let the nations be judged before Thee according to their merit.
21~Give them a legislator who by the severity of his punishments will curb and subdue them, that so they may know that they are men, that is, weak and mortal, obliged to obey Thee.
22~“<l>Despicis in opportunitatibus.</s>” Why dost Thou appear to despise me, by not consoling me when I needed Thy help? (See verse 9.)
23~The proud man boasts in vain of his prosperity, and the poor man complains in vain of his misery.
25~The wicked man has irritated God, and he should become reconciled to God; but blinded by an excess of anger or of pride he will not seek to appease him.
26~“<l>Inquinatæ sunt viæ illius in omni tempore.</s>” All the actions of his life are always stained with sin.
27~He no longer thinks, O Lord! of Thy judgments, that is, of Thy precepts, nor of the punishments with which Thou threatenest him; therefore he seeks to lord it over, that is, to oppress his enemies.
28~“<l>Sine malo.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Ero sine malo</s>—I shall be without evil.
29~“<l>Sub lingua ejus labor et dolor.</s>” His tongue serves only to bring sorrow and distress upon others.
31~“<l>Quasi leo in spelunca sua.</s>” As a lion that lies in ambush in his cave, to seize and devour those that are passing by.
32~“<l>Oblitus est Deus.</s>” God does not care for the things here below; after having created them, he forgets them.
35~“<l>Exaltetur manus tua.</s>” Let Thy power be exalted against the wicked.
36~“<l>Non requiret.</s>” God does not care for human things; he does not trouble himself about them.
37~Thou seest, O Lord! and Thou dost look upon the sufferings of the poor; and when the time comes Thou wilt cause the wicked to fall into Thy hands to punish them.
38~“<l>Orphano.</s>” Those that are destitute of all help.
39~“<l>Brachium.</s>” Power. “<l>Quæretur peccatum illius, et non invenietur.</s>” According to St. Augustine: <l>Judicabitur de peccato suo, et ipse peribit propter peccatum suum</s>—He shall be judged for his sin, and he shall be lost on account of his sin. This interpretation seems to agree with what is said in the following verse: <l>Peribitis, gentes, de terra illius</s>—Ye Gentiles shall perish from his land. Hence the sinner shall be judged according to his iniquity, and he shall no longer be found, because he will be forever lost.
41~God will always hear the desire of the just who are afflicted; he will even hearken to the preparation of their heart; that is, the interior disposition that precedes their prayers.
42~“<l>Ut non apponat ultra magnificare se homo super terram.</s>” In order that men on earth may not continue to exalt themselves, that is to say, may not grow proud by exalting themselves against Thee and against their neighbor.
0~In this psalm the just are exhorted to place confidence in God during the time of persecution.
1~This is a difficult verse; it is thus explained: In the Lord I put my trust; why, then, dost thou come to me and say: Fly to the mountain as a sparrow, to escape the vexations that afflict thee in the place in which thou art? This language is that of the just man who rejects the suggestions of the devil. When the sparrows fear to be taken in the nets of the fowlers, they flee to the mountains, which are the places more safe for them; but the just man, who trusts in God, seeks no change of place; for he knows that there are everywhere temptations of the enemy, and that everywhere God helps him who trusts in him.
2~“<l>In obscuro.</s>” In the darkness of the night, according to the Greek version, to signify that it is difficult to guard against such attacks.
3~O Lord! says the psalmist, the wicked have destroyed the laws that Thou hast made, by persecuting the just who have given them no cause for doing so.
5~From the height of the heavens, where the Lord sits as a sovereign judge, his eyes look upon the poor man, and see all things; so that the Lord knows all that passes, as if he were interrogating men. Such is the explanation of Menochius: <l>Ac si interroganti, quid actum sit, responderent</s>—Just as if they were answering him when asking them what was done.
6~The Lord puts questions, that is to say, he knows the just man to reward him, and he knows the wicked man to punish him; hence, says the psalmist, he that loves iniquity hates himself, because he draws down upon himself the divine vengeance.
7~The Lord will shower down upon sinners in this life snares by which they shall be involved in greater sins; and in the next life he will rain upon them fire, sulphur, and storms; that is, most painful torments, which will be the portion of their chalice, or their inheritance, their eternal punishment; such shall be the fruit of their sins.
8~“<l>Æquitatem vidit vultus ejus.</s>” He considers the merit of each one, in order to punish the wicked and reward the just according to justice.
0~The confidence that we should have in the mercy of God and the fear that we should always have of his justice form the twofold subject of this psalm.
1~“<l>Defecit sanctus.</s>” Men, even those that are reputed holy, have failed in keeping Thy precepts. “<l>Diminutæ sunt veritates a filiis hominum.</s>” They are found to be liars.
2~One seeks to deceive one’s neighbor by telling him vain things that are nothing but knavish tricks; one speaks with a double heart when one thinks one thing and means another.
3~Prophetic imprecation: the psalmist threatens with divine vengeance these deceivers and these proud men who boast of merits that they do not possess.
4~“<l>Linguam nostrum magnificabimus.</s>” We will make ourselves esteemed by causing our tongues to prevail. This accords with the Hebrew, which is thus translated: <l>Lingua nostra vires addemus</s>—We will strengthen our tongue. “<l>Labia nostra a nobis sunt</s>”—We have our own mouth with which to defend ourselves. “<l>Quis noster dominus est?</s>”—Who is the master that will prevent us from speaking?
6~I will put the just into a place of safety; this I will do freely; no one will be able to resist me.
7~The words and the promises of the Lord are pure and sincere, free from all falsehood and all deceit; they are as silver tried by the fire in a crucible, and refined seven times, so that it is entirely purified from the earth or dross. “<l>Probatum terræ.</s>” St. Jerome translates this: <l>Separatum a terra.</s>
8~Thou wilt always preserve us from this race of proud and deceitful men.
9~The wicked surround the just that they may oppress them; and Thou, according to the depth of Thy judgments, permittest the wicked to increase in numbers, and to delight in the good things of this world.
0~Prayer that the just man addresses to God when he is tempted and afflicted by his enemies.
2~How long shall I remain agitated and sorrowful, taking counsel with myself, to find out the means of delivering myself from my enemies?
3~“<l>Respice, et exaudi me.</s>” Look down upon my affliction, and hearken to my prayers.
4~“<l>Ne umquam obdormiam in morte.</s>” That I may never consent to temptations, which would bring death to the soul.
5~“<l>In misericordia tua speravi.</s>” I have placed all my trust in Thy mercy; Thou wilt not permit me to fall beneath their attack.
6~I will rejoice, because I have been saved by Thy help, and I will not cease to thank Thee for having assisted me.
0~The prophet deplores the blindness and the corruption of the wicked, and especially of infidels.
1~“<l>Insipiens.</s>” The fool; since the infidel who denies God is not only impious, but is also bereft of reason, for the existence of God is evident for every one that has the use of reason. “<l>In corde suo.</s>” He says this in his heart, because he does not dare to say it to others, lest he should be laughed at as a fool.
2~“<l>Corrupti sunt.</s>” The wicked say that there is no God; because they are corrupt, first in their will, and then in their understanding. “<l>In studiis suis.</s>” In following their passions.
3~The Lord has looked upon these unfortunate men to see whether any one of them knows God, and seeks him to love and obey him.
5~“<l>Sepulchrum patens.</s>” An open sepulchre, which, filled with corruption, exhales an infectious odor. “<l>Venenum aspidum sub labiis eorum.</s>” They seem to keep beneath their tongue the venom of asps, to defame and outrage others.
7~Miserable that they are! their whole life is but affliction and sadness, because they did not wish to know the way to find peace, which consists in having before one’s eyes the fear of God.
9~Their obstinacy arises from their unwillingness to call upon the Lord for help, so that he may give them his holy fear. They fear to lose the divine grace, which brings with it every good.
11~But say the wicked: Who will come from Sion to save Israel? But know that the Lord shall deliver his people from bondage, and its joy shall be great.
0~This psalm presents the portrait of a worthy minister of the altar, and at the same time that of the predestined soul, who also will have the happiness of being admitted for all eternity into the heavenly country.
7~“<l>Non movebitur in æternum.</s>” He shall surely dwell in heaven forever and ever.
0~The subject of this psalm, as St. Peter testifies (Acts 2:25), is a prayer addressed to God by our Lord Jesus Christ during the three days that his holy body was lying in the sepulchre. Resting on the authority of the prince of the apostles, Xavier Mattei and Father Rotigni rightly think that the literal sense and the spiritual sense are one and the same, and that thus the whole psalm directly refers to Jesus Christ raising his voice to his heavenly Father to address to him from the depth of the sepulchre the following prayer.
1~“<l>Bonorum meorum non eges.</s>” That is to say, that God is the sovereign master of all things.
2~According to interpreters, Jesus Christ, who is here speaking, says: God, my Father, wishes that my will should tend in a marvellous manner to benefit the saints that live on earth.
3~Jesus Christ continues to speak: Their former infirmities (that is their sins) were numerous; but afterwards healed by my merits, they became holy so that they were able to hasten to God.
4~“<l>Non congregabo conventicula eorum de sanguinibus.</s>” St. Jerome translates this after this manner: <l>Non libabo libamina eorum de sanguine</s>—Their libations of blood I will not offer. That is to say: I will never approve of the assemblies that they before held in the state of their infirmity, to celebrate sacrifices of blood.
5~“<l>Pars ... calicis mei.</s>” In olden times those that presided at a banquet assigned to each guest the portion of wine that was due to him. “<l>Restitues hereditatem meam mihi.</s>” Jesus Christ says these words to God his Father, when speaking of his resurrection.
6~It must here be observed that in ancient times the fields were measured with cords, and the part that fell to the lot of each in an inheritance.
7~I will bless the Lord, who has given me the understanding to choose himself for my inheritance; and all the affections of my heart (<l>renes mei</s>) have excited me to suffer for him with patience all tribulations, even death itself (<l>usque ad noctem</s>).
8~“<l>Ne commovear.</s>” That I may not be shaken in my desire and in the hope that I have placed in him.
9~“<l>Caro mea requiescet in spe.</s>” My body, separated from my soul, shall rest in hope of the resurrection and of the glory that the Lord has prepared for me.
10~Thou, O Lord! wilt not allow my soul to remain long in limbo, nor wilt Thou suffer my body, which is holy, to undergo corruption in the tomb.
11~“<l>Vias vitæ.</s>” The ways of life, that is to say, of resurrection, which I know is soon to restore life to my body. “<l>Delectationes in dextera tua usque in finem.</s>” Thou wilt make me enjoy Thy glory, by placing me at Thy right hand for all eternity.
0~The just man prays to God to be delivered from the persecutions to which he sees himself exposed.
1~Show favor to my innocence by hearing me; lend me a gracious ear.
2~Hear my petitions that I lay before Thee, not in words of falsehood, but of sincerity.
3~I beseech Thee that the judgment of my cause may proceed from Thy mouth, and from no other; regard justice, and judge me according to its laws.
4~“<l>Nocte.</s>” During the darkness of my desolation. “<l>Igne.</s>” By the penetrating fire of tribulation.
5~In order to avoid speaking against my persecutors, I have been attentive to the words of Thee, who commandest me to be silent, and thereby have walked in hard and very toilsome ways. I have had much to suffer.
6~Continue to direct me in Thy ways in which Thou wishest that I should walk, so that I may not go astray.
7~I have invoked Thee, and Thou hast heard me; cease not to incline Thy ear towards me by hearing all the prayers that I shall address to Thee.
9~“<l>Dextera tuæ.</s>” From those that resist Thy right hand, which defends me. “<l>Ut pupillam oculi.</s>” With great care.
10~Hide me from the eyes of the wicked who seek to oppress me.
11~“<l>Animam meam circumdederunt.</s>” They have surrounded me to take away my life. “<l>Adipem suum concluserunt.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Adipe suo concluserunt; Viscera</s> being understood. That is to say, as in the human body fat closes the bowels, so the abundance of riches fills the wicked with pride, and shuts in them the bowels of compassion for others.
12~“<l>Oculos suos statuerunt declinare in terram.</s>” Miserable men! they are determined not to lift their eyes from the ground to which they keep their hearts attached.
13~“<l>In abditis.</s>” In secret places to devour those passing by. Father Rotigni observes that this verse is applied to Jesus Christ more easily than to David, who was never taken by his enemies.
14~“<l>Animam meam.</s>” My life. “<l>Frameam tuam ab inimicis manus tuæ.</s>” Take away Thy sword, that is to say, the power to harm, which comes from Thee, from the enemies, that is to say, from those that abuse the gifts of Thy hand.
15~“<l>A paucis de terra divide eos in vita eorum.</s>” This is a passage which some, such as Bellarmine, Gordona, and Lallemant, explain thus: Separate the multitude of the wicked from the small number of Thy servants who live upon earth. Others, as Bossuet, Tirinus, and Mattei, expound it as follows: Separate, that is to say, detach the wicked during life from that little portion of earthly goods which they possess and which renders them so proud. This last interpretation seems to me to be more probable; for St. Jerome translates the Hebrew: <l>Quoniam pars in vita</s>—Whose portion is in their life; the meaning of this is, that they found on such things their present happiness; so that St. Jerome, or according to the Hebrew text the expression <l>A paucis,</s> has reference, not to the number of the just, but to the goods that the wicked enjoy in this life. In any case this passage is very obscure. “<l>De absconditis tuis adimpletus est venter eorum.</s>” They have their belly or their heart filled with their earthly goods, which they keep hidden, or which they carefully preserve; but in reality all these goods are Thine. This is the explanation also given of these obscure words: <l>De absconditis tuis.</s>
16~“<l>Parvulis.</s>” Bossuet understands by this word grand children, descendants, <l>Nepotibus.</s>
17~I hope to appear just in Thy eyes on the day when I am judged, that I may be admitted into heaven, where I shall be satiated by beholding Thy glory.
0~David gives thanks to God for having delivered him from the hands of his enemies, and especially from the hands of Saul. This psalm is applicable to the Christian soul that sees itself delivered, with God’s help, from every grave persecution or every temptation of the devil.
3~“<l>Cornu salutis meæ.</s>” That is to say, the strength that secures my salvation.
4~Therefore, he wishes to say, I will do nothing but praise and call upon the Lord in all my wants; and while acting thus I am sure that I will always be safe from the hands of my enemies.
5~“<l>Torrentes iniquitatis conturbaverunt me.</s>” My enemies have filled me with terror, and have rushed upon me like a furious torrent. Instead of <l>Conturbaverunt,</s> St. Jerome translates, according to the Hebrew: <l>Terruerunt</s>—Have terrified.
6~I have been frightened by the horrors of the tomb, that is to say, with the sadness which he feels who knows that he must soon be carried to the grave; for the snares that my enemies have laid to deprive me of life, have preoccupied me, or have filled my soul with terror.
9~God, incensed against his enemies, manifested his anger by making the earth tremble and shaking the mountains in their very foundations.
10~When God is angry there exhales from the gaping earth a terrific smoke, and from the breath of his wrath fire is kindled, with lightnings and thunders, which fall like burning coals.
11~When the clouds are near the earth it seems as if the heavens were being lowered and God himself were descending upon these clouds.
13~When the clouds are more charged with water, they become darker and they bring the rain; now, God hides himself therein as in a closed pavilion. Commentators give to this image a mystical sense, thus: The Lord, in this present life, does not make his presence sensible; he hides his majesty as in black clouds laden with dark rain; that is to say, from the depth of this obscurity he showers down graces upon his faithful souls. This may well be understood of souls that have arrived at the prayer of contemplation, and who, the more they are united with God, find themselves all the more involved in obscurity.
14~“<l>Carbones ignis.</s>” Coals of fire, that is to say, lightnings and thunders.
15~The hail, the lightning, and the thunder are the voice of the Lord by which he makes us know that he is the Most High.
17,18~Thus also has God in his anger at times brought to light the hidden sources and the innermost bowels of the earth.
19~He has received me into his arms, and has withdrawn me from a multitude of dangers and tribulations which as a deluge were overwhelming me.
20~“<l>Confortati sunt super me.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Robustiores me erant</s>—They were stronger than I.
21~“<l>Prævenerunt me.</s>” They sought to take me by surprise.
23~The Lord has rewarded me, and he will reward me according to the uprightness of my heart and the purity of my deeds.
25~All his laws are ever before my eyes, and I have never repelled from my heart his just commands.
26~I hope with his help to remain faithful to him.
27~The Lord in his goodness will grant me his graces according to the uprightness of my intention, and according to my actions that are free from defect, because they are done in his presence.
28~According to the Hebrew, the word “<l>Sanctus</s>”—Holy—signifies here merciful.
29~According to the Hebrew, the word “<l>Electus</s>”—Elect—signifies here good. “<l>Cum perverso perverteris.</s>” Thou wilt treat the perverse man as his perversity deserves.
30~“<l>Oculos superborum.</s>” The text is thus expressed, because it is especially by their eyes that the proud show their pride.
31~“<l>Lucernam meam.</s>” My lamp, that is to say, my mind, which without Thee would ever be deprived of light. “<l>Illumina tenebras meas.</s>” Enlighten my darkness by the light of Thy truth.
32~“<l>Transgrediar murum.</s>” I shall leap over the walls, that is to say, I shall overcome the difficulties that I shall have to meet in Thy service.
33~The path that God teaches me to keep is free from every defect or from every difficulty; his promises are tried by fire, that is to say, they are sincere and true.
34~“<l>Quis Deus.</s>” The translation from the Hebrew gives: <l>Quis Deus ... Quis petra; ...</s> this signifies: Where shall we find a support so firm as that which we have in our God?
35~“<l>Posuit immaculatam viam meam.</s>” He has given me the strength to pass my days free from all stain of sin.
36~He has perfected my feet by rendering them swift like those of the hart; and he has placed me on the tops of the mountains, in order to withdraw me from the hands of my enemies.
40~“<l>Non sunt infirmata vestigia mea.</s>” St. Jerome’s rendering is: <l>Non deficient tali mei,</s> that is, My ankles have not failed.
41,42~This means: I have said, O Lord! relying on Thy help: I will pursue, etc.
47,48~These verses and those that follow are properly applicable to our divine Redeemer. “<l>Populus quem non cognovi.</s>” The Gentiles.
49~My natural subjects, whom I called my children, are alienated from me, and have deceived me by pretending to serve me; they have become strangers to me, and are grown old, by becoming (according to the Hebrew text) like dry withered leaves; they have turned aside from the straight paths that they trod before. This may well be understood of Jesus Christ speaking of the Jewish people, who had become unfaithful to him.
50~“<l>Exaltetur Deus salutis meæ.</s>” May God be ever exalted, he who is the whole hope of my salvation.
53~Here it is evidently Jesus Christ who is speaking of his victories over the world and the devil.
54~We must here remark that Jesus Christ is called David by Ezeckiel and by the other prophets; and therefore the psalmist concludes by thanking the heavenly Father for all the graces bestowed upon his Son, and upon all the faithful that are his followers.
0~In this psalm we hear exalted the perfections of God, the sanctity of his law, and the magnificence of his works. In the spiritual sense it is to Jesus Christ and his Apostles that all these praises apply, according to St. Augustine, Bellarmine, Rotigni, Malvenda, Tirinus, and Gordona.
1~The heavens, by the prodigious works that we admire therein, make us know God. By the heavens the above-mentioned interpreters understand the Apostles, who by the preaching of the Gospel and by miracles have propagated upon earth the faith in Jesus Christ.
2~Each day produces or communicates for the day following and night the succeeding night, the manner of praising God; so that the heavens are unceasingly publishing the glory of the Most High.
3,4~This accords with the command that our Lord gave to his Apostles: <l>Euntes ergo docete omnes gentes</s>—Going, therefore, teach ye all nations (Matt. 28:19). And St. Paul, speaking of the preaching of the New Law by the ministry of the Apostles, says: <l>Numquid non audierunt? Et quidem in omnem terram exivit sonus eorum, et in fines orbis terræ verba eorum</s>—Have they not heard? Yea, verily: their sound hath gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the whole world (Rom. 10:18).
5~“<l>In sole posuit tabernaculum suum.</s>” The Lord has placed his pavilion in the sun, as being the principal part of the heavens. This explanation which Bellarmine gives does not please Mattei; he prefers the sense of the Hebrew text, namely: <l>Soli posuit tentorium in eis</s>—He has set in them a pavilion for the sun. But Bellarmine observes that the version of the Septuagint, which the Vulgate has followed, says, as above, that God has set his pavilion in the sun; now we should here prefer the interpretation of the Septuagint, because we may reasonably believe that at that time the Hebrew text was more correct than it is at the present day.
8~The law of the Lord is beautiful, without a defect, so that it converts souls or withdraws them from evil and from error. It is his testimony, that is to say, it makes us know his will; it is faithful in its promises, and it renders wise the little ones, that is to say, those that are docile and those that willingly submit to his precepts.
9~“<l>Justitiæ Domini.</s>” The commandments of God. “<l>Illuminans oculos.</s>” This law is full of a heavenly light, which enlightens the mind: the mind is the eye of the soul.
10~“<l>Timor Domini sanctus, permanens in sæculum sæculi.</s>” The divine law, which teaches holy fear, is permanent as to the eternal reward that it promises to him who observes it. “<l>Judicia.</s>” The precepts.
11~The divine precepts are more agreeable to virtuous souls than anything in this world.
13~“<l>Delicta quis intelligit?</s>” What man is there that knows all the sins, or, according to the translation of St. Jerome, all the errors into which we are exposed to fall, so as to be able to avoid them? “<l>Ab alienis parce servo tuo</s>” Do not permit Thy servant to associate with those that have strange, that is, bad manners. St. Jerome translates: <l>A superbis quoque libera servum tuum</s>—From the proud deliver Thy servant.
14~If I do not let my sins get the mastery over me, then I shall be free from every fault, and pure especially from grievous sins.
15~My word, or my prayers will be agreeable to Thee as well as my meditations, which I shall ever make in Thy presence.
16~It is Thou that aidest me in need and deliverest me in danger.
0~This psalm is a prayer which the people address to God for the success of the arms of David. But Bellarmine and Rotigni think that this psalm and the two following psalms, that is, 20 and 21 of the psalter, refer to the victories of Jesus Christ over the devil and the persecutors of the Church.
3~“<l>Holocaustum tuum pingue fiat.</s>” May thy holocaust be agreeable to the Lord, as are the sacrifices of fat animals (Dan. 3:40).
5~“<l>Salutari tuo.</s>” Thy safety and thy victory. “<l>Magnificabimur.</s>” Expression conformable to the Septuagint version. According to present Hebrew version, we would have: <l>Vexillum attolemus:</s> We shall lift up our banner. That is to say: We shall celebrate the victory that saves and exalts us by proclaiming the glory of the Lord, to whom it is due.
6~“<l>Christum suum.</s>” His Christ, or the King whom he hath anointed with his grace.
7~“<l>In potentatibus salus dexteræ ejus.</s>” St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>In fortitudinibus salutis dexteræ ejus.</s>
8~Our enemies put their trust in terrestrial goods and means; but we will invoke the name of our God, who gives victory to those that trust in him.
9~“<l>Obligati sunt.</s>” That is to say, according to the Septuagint version: <l>Colligati sunt, quasi compedibus</s>—They are tied down by earthly affections, as by so many fetters.
0~Hymn of thanksgiving which the people address to God for the victories granted to the arms of David. According to Bellarmine, this psalm is understood in the spiritual sense of the victory which Jesus Christ gained through the merits of his Passion over sin and over hell.
1~“<l>Super salutare tuum.</s>” On account of the salvation that he has received from Thee.
2~“<l>Voluntate labiorum ejus non fraudasti eum.</s>” Thou hast not failed to hear his prayers.
6~“<l>Dabis eum in benedictionem.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Pones eum benedictiones</s>—Thou hast set him to be blessings. These words can be verified only in Jesus Christ, the eternal source of blessings, which all receive through him.
8~“<l>Inveniatur manus tua omnibus inimicis tuis.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Inveniet manus tua omnes inimicos tuos</s>—Thy hand shall find all Thy enemies.
9~“<l>In tempore vultus tui.</s>” When Thy angry face shall make them see Thy just wrath.
11~Most justly wilt Thou deal with them, since they have endeavored to heap evils upon Thee by the many outrages that they have done Thee.
12~This verse is very obscure, and has given rise to different interpretations. Theodoret and Euthymius explain it thus: “<l>Pones eos dorsum.</s>” Thou shalt put them to flight by making them turn their back. “<l>In reliquiis tuis.</s>” That is, in their posterity. “<l>Præparabis vultum.</s>” Thou wilt show Thy angry face. Bellarmine explains it thus: “<l>Pone eos dorsum</s>”—Thou shalt make them as though they were nothing but back, a part of the body exposed to the scourger. “<l>In reliquiis tuis præparabis vultum eorum.</s>” You will cause that their sight, for their greater punishment, be fixed in considering Thy elect, who are the remnant reserved and saved by Thee. Mattei, Menochius, Bossuet, and Tirinus take this whole verse all in one sense, and explain it thus: Thou wilt discharge Thy arrows so thick in their face that they will be forced to turn and take to flight. Let the reader choose whichever of these explanations he pleases; the last, however, agrees best with the Hebrew text, according to which, instead of the words “<l>In reliquiis tuis,</s>” it is <l>In nervis;</s> signifying the string of the bow on which the arrow is placed.
0~This psalm is to be understood in the literal sense of Jesus Christ, and especially of the prayer which he said before his death from the height of the cross, as also of his glorious resurrection. According to Cardinal Bellarmine, it would be an act of temerity to seek to turn it to any other sense. We have then in this psalm an express prophecy of all that which our Lord suffered when dying on the cross.
1~My God, look upon the affliction in which I am; why hast Thou abandoned me? I see well that my sins, that is, the sins of my people, which I have taken upon myself to expiate, as if they were my own. Keep me far from my salvation, that is, make it impossible for me not to die. We make here the following observation on the abandonment of Jesus Christ: It is certain that the divine Word did not abandon the humanity of Jesus Christ when he was dying upon the cross. But why did our Saviour say: <l>Deus meus, Deus meus, ut quid dereliquisti me?</s>—My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? (Matt. 27:46.) St. Leo answers: <l>Vox ista doctrina est, non querela</s>—That voice utters teaching, not complaint (De Pass. s. 16). Jesus Christ did not thus speak to the eternal Father to be delivered from death, nor was he speaking of his own abandonment, but of the abandonment of grace, of which all men would have remained deprived if he had not died for our salvation. He was praying then in our name, that we might be delivered from eternal death; in our name also he prayed for his resurrection, to make us also have a share therein. So that he then put himself in our place, and thus prayed not to be abandoned, whilst at the same time he offered up his own death in order to save us from the abandonment that we had deserved, and he did not die himself until he had at first made our salvation secure. This is the reason why, towards the end of the psalm, he gives thanks to his Father, and sings the fruits of his victory.
2~I invoke Thee by day, and Thou dost not hear me; I invoke Thee also by night; ah! attribute not my prayers to imprudence and indiscretion.
3~“<l>Laus Israel.</s>” Thou art the praise of Israel on account of the many graces that Thou hast vouchsafed to him; but now it seems to me that Thou wilt not listen to me.
4~Our Lord is here speaking of the deliverance which the holy Fathers under the Old Law were to obtain by his death.
6~“<l>Sum vermis, et non homo.</s>” Behold! I am no longer looked upon as a man, but as a worm of the earth.
7~All seeing me reduced to this miserable state have set themselves to mock me: they have spoken against me, and insult me by wagging their heads. A reference to the words that we read in the Gospel: <l>Prætereuntes autem blasphemabant eum, moventes capita sua</s>—And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads (Matt. 27:39).
8~They have said: He put his hope in the Lord; let then the Lord deliver him, since he has a will for him and protects him. Moreover, we read in the Gospel: <l>Confidit in Deo; liberet nunc, si vult eum</s>—He trusted in God; let him now deliver him, if he will have him (Matt. 27:43).
9,10~It was Thou, O Lord, who hast drawn me out of the womb of my mother, and from her breasts; since then I have placed in Thee all my hopes; I have always acknowledged Thee for my God; in mercy, then, do not abandon me.
11~Bellarmine says that Jesus Christ is here speaking of his death which is approaching, as what precedes and what follows clearly prove.
12~By bulls are meant the chief priests and Pharisees, who by their sharp words and mocking jeers, as if with thrusts of horns, insulted Jesus Christ, saying: <l>Alios salvos fecit, seipsum non potest salvum facere; si rex Israel est, descendat nunc de cruce, et credemus ei</s>—He saved others; himself he cannot save; if he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him (Matt. 27:42).
13~“<l>Sicut leo rapiens et rugiens.</s>” Like so many famished lions greedy to devour me, roaring with rage. Such were the Jews when they cried out to Pilate: <l>Tolle, tolle; crucifige eum</s>—Away with him, away with him, crucify him (John 19:15).
14~“<l>Sicut aqua effusus sum.</s>” I am spent of all my strength through the shedding of my blood, which has poured forth from my body like water from a vase. “<l>Dispersa.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Divulsa</s>—Torn from their sockets, out of joint.
15~Notwithstanding all that, my heart, far from being hardened against my enemies, has become soft like melted wax, through the compassion that I have for their evils.
16~“<l>Et in pulverem mortis deduxisti me.</s>” In short, Thou hast, O my God, brought me to lie beneath the dust of the tomb that covers the dead.
18~They have pierced my hands and my feet with nails; they have so stretched my body upon the cross that all my bones can be counted. In these words David clearly describes the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; thus St. Jerome, St. Augustine, Theodoret, and Euthymius explain the passage.
19~My executioners after crucifying me have set themselves to watch me with contempt, and to gaze upon my sufferings with complacency. They have parted my garments among them, and for my under-tunic, which was woven entire, and without seam, they cast lots. This text is quoted in the Gospel where we read: <l>Ut impleretur quod dictum est per Prophetam, dicentem: Diviserunt sibi,</s> etc.—That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided my garments, etc. (Matt. 27:35). This is a certain proof that our Saviour died naked upon the cross.
21~Save my life promptly from the sword of death by raising up my body after I shall be dead. Cause my soul, which appears now left alone and abandoned, to triumph over the infernal dog.
22~Save me from the lion, which keeps its mouth open to devour me; and protect my weakness from the assaults of these ferocious unicorns.
23~The prophet here speaks more expressly of the resurrection of our Lord, and of the fruit that it would produce, namely, the conversion of the Gentiles. He says: I will publish the glory of Thy name by means of my brethren the apostles, etc.
24~“<l>Semen Jacob.</s>” By this is meant Christians who have the faith of Jacob.
25~“<l>Pauperis.</s>” This poor man is Jesus Christ himself, who died upon the cross naked and abandoned by all.
27~I will praise Thee, O Lord, in the great assembly, the Church of the faithful gathered together from all the nations. In their presence I will pay my vows, renewing my sacrifice, by the ministry of my priests.
28~The poor in spirit, who are conscious of their spiritual misery, shall feed upon and be satiated with grace; and they that seek the Lord shall praise him, and hence their souls shall live eternally.
29,30~All the nations even to the farthest bounds of the earth shall call to mind the benefits of God, and the mysteries of the Redemption, which shall be preached to them, and they shall be converted to the Lord; so that all the nations of the Gentiles shall enter the Church to adore the true God.
32~Not only the poor, but also “<l>Pingues terræ.</s>” the great and powerful of the earth, who abound in riches, shall eat at the table of the Lord, and shall adore him; and in bowing down to adore, they shall humble themselves even to the earth. “<l>In terram.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In pulverem</s>—To the dust. Hence this other interpretation, which is also probable: All men, who since they are mortal must return to dust, shall prostrate themselves before him.
34~The generation to come of believers shall receive the good tidings of the Lord, that is to say, the knowledge of the faith; and the heavens, or heavenly men, shall publish the justice of God, or the justice of faith, which makes men just, to the new people that shall be born to the life of grace; a people which the Lord has made, that is, a special people of God, created in Jesus Christ.
0~The principal end of this psalm is to represent God as a good shepherd who omits nothing, so that in the order of eternal salvation his servants may be abundantly provided with help and spiritual means. The verses 1, 2, 6, and 7 plainly refer to this preeminent benefit, which consists in the partaking of the body and blood of Jesus Christ.
2~He has nourished me near waters that flow in the very place of my pasturage; and when my soul like a silly, wayward sheep, went away from him, he brought it back again to his fold.
4~“<l>In medio umbra mortis.</s>” In the midst of a thousand dangers that seem to me to be the figure of death.
5~The shepherd’s crook and the staff which Thou hast in hand console me; for with the crook Thou correctest me when I go out of the path, and with the staff Thou dost drive away the wolves that seek to devour me. “<l>Virga.</s>” Some commentators understand by this the Blessed Virgin Mary, who was called <l>Virga de radice Jesse</s>—a rod out of the root of Jesse (Is. 11:1), of whom was born Jesus.
6~Thou hast prepared before me a table where I shall take a food that will make me strong against my enemies. By this table we may well understand the altar, where we receive as food the body of Jesus Christ, which renders us strong against all the assaults of hell.
7~“<l>In oleo.</s>” With the unction of Thy grace. “<l>Calix meus inebrians.</s>” The chalice that Thou offerest me contains a wine that holily inebriates him that drinks it, making him forget the world to remember only Thee and Thy love. “<l>Quam præclarus est!</s>” How noble and precious is it!
9~“<l>In longitudinem dierum.</s>” During all eternity.
0~David here announces, according to the exclusively literal sense of the psalm, the principal mysteries of the natural law. He predicts the vocation of the Gentiles; he describes the character of the predestined; he speaks of the interior justice with which the souls of the faithful will be adorned by the grace of Jesus Christ; in fine, after having referred to the divinity of our Lord, he prophesies his victories and his glorious ascension into heaven.
2~God has thus prepared the earth to be the habitation of man.
3~Heaven is called a mountain by reason of its elevation; and it is the sanctuary of God, where he has his throne.
4~He shall ascend thither who has not sinned in his works, and has kept his heart pure, that is, detached from creatures; he who has not received his life in vain, that is, who has not only avoided evil, but has also fulfilled what God has enjoined on him; he who loves truth, and has not sworn falsely to deceive his neighbors.
6~Such is the happy generation of those that seek God by being attentive to serve him, and that long to go to see in heaven the God of Jacob. According to the Hebrew text, we read: <l>Quærentium faciem tuam, O Jacob!</s> Bellarmine says that this phrase is obscure; hence the Septuagint-interpreters supplied here the word God, and have rendered the verse as we have it in the Vulgate, for it is only God who makes the joy of the saints.
7~O angels, princes of the heavenly city! lift up, open the gates which have been given to you to guard; and yourselves, O eternal gates! (that is, you who have been shut from all eternity, as is explained by Rotigni) be ye lifted up, be ye opened, and the King of Glory shall enter.
8~“<l>In prælio.</s>” In the battle with his enemies whom he has conquered and discomfited.
0~Exposed to persecution, David begs God’s help; and regarding his afflictions as a just punishment for his sins, he renews his acts of repentance. We may therefore recite this psalm for ourselves when we are assailed and tormented by temptations which men and demons raise against us.
1~“<l>Non erubescam.</s>” I hope by Thy help that I shall not have the confusion of seeing myself conquered by my enemies.
2~Suffer not that they have me in derision by gaining a victory over me; for all those that wait on Thee shall never be confounded.
3~Let all the wicked rather be speedily put to confusion at seeing how they have worked their iniquity in vain, without the fruit they hoped for.
4~Show me the ways by which Thou wouldst have me walk; teach me to keep the paths that lead to Thee.
5~“<l>In veritate tua.</s>” In the straight way of Thy law. “<l>Te sustinui tota die.</s>” From Thee I continually look for the help that I need.
6~“<l>Quæ a sæculo sunt.</s>” Which Thou showest to the world for so many ages.
9~“<l>Legem dabit delinquentibus in via.</s>” To those that have sinned in this life he will give the rule to follow so as to be able to return to the right way.
10~He will guide the gentle by the straight paths of his law, which in the Scriptures is called <l>Judicium</s>—Judgment; he will teach the docile of heart to walk in his ways.
11~The whole conduct of the Lord is full of mercy and of fidelity to his promises towards his servants, who keep before their eyes the covenant made between God and those that are faithful to his precepts.
12~Thou wilt show mercy with regard to my sins, and their pardon will cause Thy glory to shine forth all the more brightly because they have been grievous and many.
13~Who is the man that truly fears God? It is he to whom the Lord has taught the way he has chosen to walk.
14~His soul shall dwell in good things, that is, it shall be continually enriched with goods spiritual and temporal; and his children, following his good example, shall be heirs of the Promised Land, that is, of heaven.
15~“<l>Testamentum ipsius, ut manifestetur illis.</s>” To those to whom he manifests the covenant that he has made to protect his faithful servants.
16~I will then keep my eyes ever fixed upon the Lord, for he it is that shall deliver me from the snares that Thy enemies lay for me.
17~My God, turn Thy eyes towards me, and have pity upon me, for I am alone and poor, and my enemies are many and powerful.
18~“<l>De necessitatibus.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>De pressuris</s>—Distresses.
19~“<l>Delicta mea.</s>” My sins, which I know to be the cause of my affliction.
21~“<l>Non erubescam, quoniam speravi in te.</s>” Verily I shall not be confounded, after having placed all my confidence in Thee.
22~The just and the upright of heart have united to defend me, seeing that I have put my trust in Thee.
23~Have pity on those that belong to the people of Israel, and deliver them from all their affliction.
0~This psalm teaches all those that are unjustly persecuted what virtues they should practise during their trial. Moreover, it makes and explains in detail what are the dispositions with which we should approach the altar, whether to communicate or to offer the holy Sacrifice.
1~Be my judge against my persecutors, since I present myself with an unblemished conscience, having nothing to reproach myself with; I hope that Thou wilt not permit that I be declared guilty.
2~Try my fidelity; put to the test in the fire of tribulation my heart and all its secret folds.
3~I abide in peace, because I have not lost sight of Thy mercy, and have tried to live according to the truth, that is, Thy law.
4~I have avoided the company of vain and lying men, and I will ever guard against entering the society of the wicked.
5~“<l>Malignantium.</s>” Malicious persons, who turn even good actions to evil.
6,7~I will seek to wash my hands, that is, to purify myself together with the just; and so united with them, I will also join in surrounding Thy altar; that there I may hear the voices of those that praise Thee; and that I may publish all the marvels that Thou hast wrought.
10~They commit acts of injustice in order to receive gifts.
0~David persecuted by Saul and surrounded by every kind of peril shows no less courage by the confidence that he has in the divine protection; he sighs at the same time after the sight of the Tabernacle. He is a figure of the just man who in the midst of the enemies of his salvation longs to leave this world, and to enter into the heavenly kingdom.
3,4~My enemies advance against me like ferocious beasts, to devour my body; but those that ill-treat me I have seen weakened and cast down.
8~When visiting the Temple of the Lord, I may taste the sweetness that he communicates to those that love him.
10~He has placed me as upon a high rock, so that now I hold my head above my enemies; that is to say, I have overcome them.
11~“<l>Circuivi, et immolavi.</s>” In the Hebrew this is in the future, which agrees better with the rest of the verse. The sense, therefore, is: United with the priests, I will go around the altar, and will offer.
12~“<l>Vocem meam, qua clamavi ad te.</s>” The urgent prayer that I have addressed to Thee.
13~In the past, my heart, or my desire, which is well known to Thee, has already told Thee that my eyes have sought Thee; for the future, I will try to be always in Thy presence, to obey Thee and to love Thee.
14~“<l>In ira.</s>” In wrath, as a punishment for my sins.
17~Teach me, O God! to walk according to Thy law, and guide me in the right path that leads to Thee, in order that I may not fall into the hands of my enemies.
18~“<l>Mentita est iniquitas sibi.</s>” Their iniquity has lied, that is, has been injurious to themselves.
19~I hope to enjoy in the land of the living that is, in the kingdom of the blessed, where death has no access the good things that the Lord has prepared for those that love him.
20~“<l>Sustine Dominum.</s>” Expect the help of the Lord; he will never fail Thee.
0~David, in the midst of persecutions, implores the help of God, and foretells his triumph. There is not one among the faithful who cannot apply this psalm to himself in view of the temptations and perils of which his life here upon earth is so full.
1~“<l>Ad te, Domine, clamabo.</s>” O Lord! I will not cease to cry to Thee to obtain help. “<l>Ne sileas a me.</s>” Keep not silence, as if Thou didst not hear my prayers. “<l>Assimilabor descendentibus in lacum.</s>” I shall become like those that find themselves shut up in the tomb, whence their voice can no longer be heard.
3~“<l>Ne simul trahas me.</s>” Do not permit me to fall over precipices.
5~“<l>Secundum nequitiam adinventionum ipsorum.</s>” According to their malice, which invents artifices to injure others.
6~“<l>Redde retributionem eorum ipsis.</s>” Cause the evil that they are plotting for others to fall upon themselves.
7~“<l>Non intellexerunt.</s>” They did not wish to understand. “<l>Non ædificabis eos.</s>” Thou wilt not restore them to their former state.
10~Through the help that I have received, my flesh, that is, my weakness, has regained its vigor; therefore I will always sing with all my heart the praises of my Saviour.
11~“<l>Christi sui.</s>” Christ, or the anointed of the Lord. David thus calls himself, as having received from God the royal unction.
0~The prophet here invites the people to come to adore God in his Temple. Under this figure the Gentiles are invited to receive the Gospel, which had to be preached in the midst of persecutions, here represented by the winds, the tempests, and the thunders, which are mentioned in this psalm.
1~“<l>Filios arietum.</s>” Young rams, to offer them to him in sacrifice.
3~The Lord makes his voice heard upon the waters during the storms; in the noise that is then produced by the abundance of the waters, mingled with peals of thunder, he makes the voice of his majesty heard.
4~“<l>In virtute.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In potentia</s>—In power. The Lord makes his voice known in his power and in his grandeur; for when he wills he makes the earth and the sea tremble.
5~“<l>Cedros Libani.</s>” That is to say: The loftiest and strongest trees, which it destroys by the violence of the tempests.
6~“<l>Comminuet.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Saltare faciet</s>—He shall make them leap as a calf that goes bounding over the mountain of Libanon. “<l>Dilectus.</s>” The unicorn, when little, is admired for its beauty.
7~“<l>Intercidentis flammam.</s>” St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>Dividens flammas;</s> that is to say, the thunder darts a number of lightning flashes one after the other. “<l>Desertum Cades.</s>” A vast desert of Arabia.
8~“<l>Præparantis cervos.</s>” This means, according to some interpreters, that the thunder so terrifies the deer that parturition is hastened. These authors rest on the Hebrew text, which is thus translated: <l>Vox Domini parere faciens cervas</s>—The voice of the Lord makes hinds bring forth. But I prefer the interpretation of Mattei, who says that the voice of the Lord, or the thunder, so frightens the deer as to drive them from their thickets; and he observes that the Vulgate does not use the word <l>Cervas,</s> but <l>Cervos.</s> “<l>Et revelabit condensa; et in templo ejus omnes dicent gloriam.</s>” That is to say, the Lord lays open to daylight the thick forests by shivering and uprooting the trees with his thunderbolts; after which all men will go to render homage to the glory or to the power of the Most High in his Temple.
9~God makes the deluge of waters that inundate the earth to dwell, to abide, or last; and he himself, as Lord and eternal King seated upon the clouds, disposes everything for his glory.
10~The Lord will give to his people the virtue of trusting in his protection; and then blessing them he will fill them with peace.
0~Thanksgiving addressed by David to God for having delivered him from a dangerous illness. This psalm is very suitable to every Christian who, having been assailed by his passions, is in danger of falling into temptations.
1~I will praise Thee by giving thanks, because Thou hast taken me under Thy protection, and hast not allowed my enemies to sing victories over me.
3~“<l>Eduxisti ab inferno animam meam.</s>” Thou hast brought me back from the tomb.
4~“<l>Sancti ejus.</s>” You who are his faithful servants. “<l>Memoriæ sanctitatis ejus.</s>” That is to say: For his holy memory that he has of you, to do you good.
5~The wrath of God, or chastisement, comes from the indignation that he conceives against the sinner on account of his sin; on the other hand, life or salvation comes from the will of God, who in his goodness desires to save man.
6~“<l>Demorabitur.</s>” Pagnini translates: <l>Pernoctabit.</s> Hence the sense is: Though the Lord cause us to pass the night in sadness, in the morning he will give us joy.
7~Finding myself in an abundance of consolations, I said: I shall never be deprived of my happiness.
8~Thou hast wished to give to my glory and to my happiness strength; that is, solidity.
10~Nevertheless, O Lord! I will never cease to cry to Thee, who art my God, and to pray to Thee to help me.
11~What fruit couldst thou draw from my blood; that is to say, as St. Augustine explains this verse by applying it to Jesus Christ, from the shedding of my blood, or from my death? But, literally, it is better understood of David himself, who fears that he will not be able after death to do the good that he can do in life, as he explains in the following verse.
12~Will, then, dust, or my body reduced to dust after death, be yet able to praise Thee, and to publish the faithfulness of Thy promises?
14~“<l>Saccum.</s>” Garment of mourning and humiliation.
15~“<l>Non compungar.</s>” Let not my sadness hinder me any longer from praising Thee. According to the Hebrew: <l>Non taceat.</s> That is to say: Let not my glory cease to praise Thee. “<l>In æternum confitebor tibi.</s>” I will never cease to celebrate Thy glories, and I will ever thank Thee for Thy benefits.
0~Forced by his son Absalom to leave Jerusalem, David asks help of God. This psalm is perfectly suited to a Christian who sees himself assailed by temptations, and who, animated by confidence, asks God for aid and protection. It must be remarked that our Lord Jesus Christ makes to himself the application of the sixth verse of this psalm: a proof that the persecution of David prefigures that which our Redeemer had to endure at the hands of the Jews.
1~“<l>In justitia tua libera me.</s>” Deliver me from confusion by Thy justice, according to which Thou punishest the guilty and protectest the innocent.
2~Incline Thy ear to my prayers, and hasten to deliver me from the peril in which I find myself.
4~Thou art my strength in temptations, and my refuge in persecutions; I hope that for the glory of Thy name Thou wilt lead me safe through all dangers, and provide for me in all my wants.
6~Into Thy hands I commit my life, because many other times Thou hast delivered me from death, Thou who art my Lord and my God, ever faithful in Thy promises. Some think that these words, and indeed the whole psalm, are to be understood of Jesus Christ, because before expiring he said on the cross: <l>Pater, in manus tuas commendo spiritum meum.</s> Bellarmine, however, justly observes that our Lord, in dying, might well use these words, but not the following: <l>Redemisti me, Domine, Deus veritatis</s>—Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth; for Jesus Christ was himself the Redeemer, and not the redeemed.
7~“<l>Observantes vanitates, supervacue.</s>” St. Jerome translates the passage thus: <l>Custodientes vanitates frustra</s>—Thou dost hate those who keep, that is, who love the vanities, or the false goods of this world; which they do uselessly, <l>supervacue,</s> for they will never find the peace for which they hope.
9~Thou hast looked upon my weakness, and Thou hast saved my life from many dangers.
10~Thou hast given me a large field, to deliver myself from the enemies that would close the way against me.
11~Have pity on me, O Lord! for I see myself troubled by the remembrance of my sins; my eyes, my soul, and my bowels, that is to say, all my powers, exterior and interior, are troubled at the sight of Thy anger, provoked by my infidelity. Such is the explanation given by Bellarmine, who follows St. Augustine.
14~“<l>Timor notis meis.</s>” My friends are afraid of being known to be my friends.
20~“<l>Illustra faciem tuam super servum tuum.</s>” Turn Thy gracious eyes upon me. “<l>Non confundar.</s>” I hope that I shall not be abandoned by Thee.
21~“<l>Erubescant impii, et deducantur in infernum.</s>” May confusion fall rather upon the wicked, and may they be buried in eternal oblivion.
22~“<l>In abusione.</s>” According to the Hebrew and Greek: <l>In contemptu</s>—with contempt.
23~“<l>Quam abscondisti.</s>” An expression that shows that this treasure is hidden from the wicked, who do not fear God.
25~Thou wilt make them enjoy in secret Thy sensible presence, as happens to certain privileged souls. In this secret place they are sure not to be troubled by men of the world, or by human passions.
28~“<l>In excessu mentis meæ.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In stupore meo</s>—In the excess of my tribulation, which held me stupefied.
30~“<l>Veritatem requiret.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Sinceros itueturn</s>—He protects the sincere. The sense of the verse is: All you that serve the Lord, love him; for he will test your innocence, and he will know well how to defend those that love him, as he knows how to punish the proud with terrible torments.
0~This psalm teaches us what a happy life one leads when, having returned from wicked ways, one does penance; and, on the other hand, what an unhappy life one leads when one persists in remaining in sin.
1~“<l>Quorum tecta sunt peccata.</s>” Whose sins have been covered, that is to say, blotted out. Protestants use these words, to prove, as they say, that sins, though forgiven by the mercy of God, are not removed from the soul, but are only covered, so that the stain of guilt remains in the soul, and that God always sees this stain; but he remits the penalty due, as if he did not see it. They add that God remits the sin only so far as he does not impute it to the sinner, according to what is said in the following verse: <l>Beatus vir citi non imputavit Dominus peccatum</s>—Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin. But all this is false; for God, in forgiving sins, does not cover them, but for the merits of Jesus Christ he takes them away from the penitent soul, as holy Scripture says: <l>Dominus quoque transtulit peccatum tuum</s>—The Lord also hath taken away thy sins (2 Kings 12:13). <l>Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit peccatum mundi</s>—Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who taketh away the sins of the world. Moreover, as the Council of Trent has declared, man is justified not only by the remission of sin, but by grace and inherent justice. And if it is said that God does not impute sin, this is, so far as he remits and blots it out, as the same Council also teaches (Sess. 6, de Justif. cap. 7, can. 11).
2~“<l>Non imputavit peccatum.</s>” Has not imputed his sin, because he has forgiven it him. “<l>Nec est in spiritu ejus dolus.</s>” He has sincerely repented of his fault.
3~I did not confess my sin, and this silence made me lament the whole day long, so that my bones have grown old; that is to say, my continual tears have weakened me, as if my bones had become old, or had lost their strength and were broken. St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>Attrita sunt ossa mea, in rugitu meo tota die</s>—My bones are bruised so that the whole day I cried out through pain.
4~Thou hast afflicted me with justice; and hence when tribulation was piercing me like a sharp thorn, the only course I took was to return to Thee, my God, beseeching Thy mercy. “<l>Configitur.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Configitur mihi.</s>
6~When I had resolved to confess my injustice, Thou didst at once pardon me my enormous fault.
7~“<l>Pro hac.</s>” That is to say, according to Bellarmine and Mattei: For this reason. “<l>Omnis sanctus.</s>” According to the Chaldee: “<l>Omnis pius.</s>” That is to say: Every sinner truly penitent, who is holy and pious, because in stripping himself of his impiety he clothes himself with holiness by means of grace. “<l>In tempore opportune</s>” In this life, when we can obtain forgiveness of our sins before death.
8~In the flood of many waters, that is to say, at death and at judgment, when scourges shall fall as a torrent upon the wicked, they shall then no more approach God, because there will then be no longer any pardon for them.
10~Here David makes the Lord speak to the penitent sinner. “<l>Firmabo super te oculos meos.</s>” I will continue to look upon thee with a favorable eye, and to protect thee.
11~The Lord addresses these words to those that are hardened sinners.
12~Restrain, O Lord! those that keep far from Thee, and force them to obey Thee.

14~“<l>Gloriamini.</s>” Let your glory be to serve and to love the Lord.
0~The psalmist exhorts the just to praise the Lord, to fear his judgments, and to confide in his mercy.
3~“<l>Bene psallite ei in vociferatione.</s>” Bossuet understands the word <l>Psallite</s> in the sense of playing an instrument, and not in that of singing. Hence the phrase signifies: Let your voices be in accord with the sound of instruments.
5~He loves mercy and justice; but the earth is filled with mercy rather than justice.
6~“<l>Spiritu oris ejus omnis virtus eorum.</s>” For “<l>Virtus</s>” St. Jerome translates <l>Ornatus</s>—adornment, by which is meant the stars. The sense, then, is, that God by a breath of his mouth, or by another word, adorned the heavens with stars.
7~“<l>Ponens in thesauris abyssos.</s>” The Lord holds the abysses, or the waters of the sea, in his treasures; that is to say, in reserve, to dispose of them according to his good pleasure, either for doing good to men or for punishing them.
8~“<l>Ab eo autem commoveantur.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Ipsum formident</s>—Let them fear him.
9~Whatever God said, or wished, was done.
11~All the thoughts of his mind, which are hidden to us, shall always have their fulfilment.
12~Blessed is the nation that makes God, and not his creatures, its last end.
15~It is he that created their hearts, or their souls. “<l>Singillatim</s>” One by one, as Bellarmine, Menochius, and Tirinus explain it. “<l>Intelligit omnia opera eorum.</s>” He well understands and penetrates all the motives of their actions.
0~In this psalm the prophet exhorts us constantly to praise the Lord for his tender and continual care of his servants, and for the assistance that he deigns to grant us in all our tribulations.

9~“<l>Timete Dominum, omnes sancti ejus.</s>” All ye servants of the Lord, fear him. There is question here of a filial, not of a servile fear.
10~The rich ones of this world, though possessing in abundance the good of this earth, suffer hunger and thirst, because they find no peace in them; but those that seek the Lord, even in poverty, are filled with every good.

22~The Lord shall rescue from every danger the souls of his servants, and he will not permit any of them that trust in him to fail in their duties.
0~This psalm is suitable to the just man who, seeing himself exposed here below to the temptations of the devil and to bad treatment on the part of impious men, seeks help from God.
1~“<l>Judica</s>” Punish as they deserve.
2~“<l>Apprehende arma et scutum.</s>” Take Thy arms to strike my enemies, and Thy shield to protect me.
3~“<l>Effunde.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Evagina</s>—Unsheathe.
4~“<l>Quærentes animam meam.</s>” Those that seek to take away my life.
6~“<l>Angelus Domini.</s>” The angel, the minister of the Lord’s justice.
7~“<l>Fiat via illorum tenebræ et lubricum.</s>” That is to say: Let them fall over a precipice. He that walks by night on a slippery path, can hardly avoid meeting with a dangerous fall.
8~Without cause on my part they have set their snares, or laid ambush, to take my life, and loaded me with injuries.
9~“<l>Laqueus.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Calamitas,</s> That is to say: Let there come upon him a calamity which he did not expect. “<l>Captio.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Retis</s>—A net.

14~“<l>Sterilitatem.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Orbitatem</s>—Privation, despoiling. That is to say: They sought to strip me of everything.
16~I afflicted myself by fasting, humbling myself before God, as a man who is worthy of this bad treatment, and praying for my persecutors; if my prayer does not benefit them, it will turn at least to my own profit.
17~I loved to pray for him who persecuted me, as if he had been my friend and my brother; I suffered for him, weeping and afflicted myself with his miseries, as a mother weeps for the sorrows of her son. Such is the sense of the Hebrew, according to the translation of St. Jerome: <l>Quasi ad amicum, quasi ad fratrem meum, sic ambulabam; quasi lugens mater, tristis incurvabar</s>—As a mother mourning and sad, so did I go my way.
18~They, on the contrary, rejoiced at my ills: yet more, they conspired against me; and when I least thought of it, the scourges were gathered together over me.
19~They have been scattered by the Lord; yet they have not repented: on the contrary, they have continued to tempt me, now mocking at me in scorn, and now gnashing their teeth at me in rage.
20~When wilt Thou look upon me with an eye of pity? Ah! deliver me from the malice of those who, like lions, lie in wait for my life.
21~If Thou art propitious to my prayer, I will give Thee thanks on the solemn days, when the nation is assembled, and there in the presence of a great people I will praise Thy mercy.
22~“<l>Annuunt oculis.</s>” To deceive me, they pretend to look upon me with a good eye. On these words St. Augustine thus comments: <l>Quid est Annuentes oculis? Pronunciantes vultu, quod in corde non gestant</s>—What is, Winking with the eyes? To express by look what one has not in the heart.
23~“<l>In iracundia terræ.</s>” According to the anger of an earthly heart. Such is the explanation of Bellarmine and of Bossuet.
24~“<l>Viderunt oculi nostri.</s>” We have seen what we wished to see.
25~“<l>Ne sileas.</s>” Punish them.
27~“<l>Non supergaudeant mihi.</s>” Let my enemies no more rejoice over my misfortunes (see verse 22).
31~“<l>Pacem servi ejus.</s>” Peace or prosperity of the servant of God. Thus Bellarmine, Malvenda, and others, following St. Jerome, explain the verse.
0~The psalmist here shows how great, on the one hand, is the malice of sinners, and, on the other hand, how great is the mercy of God set forth to convert them. It also at the same time makes known with what goodness our Lord treats the just.
1~The wicked man has said in his heart, or has resolved (as is explained by Bellarmine and Mattei), to sin freely; and he acts thus because he has no longer the fear of God before his eyes.
2~This is a very difficult verse. St. Augustine explains it thus: <l>In odio, persequente iniquitate sua, dolose egit coram Deo</s>—Out of hatred, pursuing his path of crime, he acts deceitfully before God; words that are applicable to sacrilegious confessions. The Rabbinists explain the Hebrew text thus: The wicked man sins, flattering himself that God does not see and does not abhor his iniquity. But Mattei believes that some words are wanting in the Hebrew text; his opinion is that the psalmist is not speaking here of deceitful hypocrites, but of obstinate sinners; and he explains the verse in this manner: The sinner acts perversely before the eyes of God, so that his iniquity may draw down the divine hatred upon himself. Such is also the explanation given by Bellarmine and Bossuet.
3~“<l>Noluit intelligere ut bene ageret.</s>” He does not wish to understand what is good, so as not to be obliged to practise it.
4~On his bed he premeditates to do evil, and he gives himself to every wicked means; for, far from hating evil, he loves it.
5~That is to say: Thy mercy and Thy fidelity to Thy promises are immense and infinite.
6~Thy justice is as great as a mountain, and as a divine mountain that is high beyond our sight; and Thy judgments are to us abysses very obscure and impenetrable.
7~“<l>Homines et jumenta salvabis.</s>” Bellarmine explains this passage by saying that God wishes to save not only good men, but also those who, by following their sensual appetites, make themselves like brute beasts.
8~“<l>In tegmine alarum tuarum.</s>” That is to say: Relying on Thy protection and Thy Providence.
9~Thou wilt make them participate in the infinite joy that Thou Thyself dost experience.
10~“<l>In lumine tuo, videbimus lumen.</s>” Illumined by Thy divine light, we shall see Thyself who art the Light by essence.
11~“<l>Justitiam tuam.</s>” The just reward that Thou hast prepared for each one according to his deserts.
12~St. Augustine thus explains this verse: O Lord! suffer not that pride set its foot on me, or gain dominion over me, nor that the hand of the sinner, that is, of the devil or of any of his followers, detach me from Thy service.
13~“<l>Ibi.</s>” There, in pride. “<l>Expulsi sunt, nec potuerunt stare.</s>” They have been driven out of heaven, and it is precisely on account of their pride that they were not able to remain there.
0~The prophet exhorts the just to persevere in the practice of virtue and to confide in the mercy of God, without allowing themselves to be moved by the prosperity which the wicked enjoy in this world.
1~“<l>Neque zelaveris facientes iniquitatem.</s>” Do not allow yourself to be moved by zeal, that is to say, by envy of their happiness. Or rather: Be not inflamed against sinners on account of their happiness, as if complaining to God for favoring them as he does.
2~They shall wither as the grass that falls under the scythe; they shall fall as the herb deprived of its root.
3~“<l>Inhabita terram, et pasceris in divitiis ejus.</s>” Therefore, dwell in the land, and God will feed thee with his delights. Or, as others understand this: Cultivate the land, and thou shalt be abundantly provided with its fruits.
4~Make thy happiness to consist in pleasing God; or make the Lord thy delight, and he will satisfy all thy requests, or all thy desires.
5~Lay before God all the wants and desires of thy life; put thy trust in him, and he will do all that thou desirest.
6~He will even draw forth from the darkness thy innocence as a torch of flame, and he will cause it to shine as the sun at noonday; obey the Lord, and be attentive to pray for his help.
8~“<l>Ut maligneris.</s>” So as to become wicked like them.
9~The wicked shall be exterminated by the hand of God; but those that expect with patience the help of the Lord shall be heirs of the land of promise, which is heaven.
10~Wait a little while, and thou wilt see that this sinner, now so puffed up with pride about his goods, shall be no more; thou wilt seek the place or the prosperous state in which he lived, and thou wilt no longer find it.
11~On the contrary, the meek, like the humble, shall possess the land which was destined to them for their inheritance and shall enjoy great peace.
12~The sinner will look with contempt on the life of the just man; and he will conceive great hatred for him so as to desire to oppress him.
13~“<l>Dies ejus.</s>” The day on which he will be punished as he deserves.
16~Understood: God grant that, etc.
17~The just man is more content with the little that he possesses than are sinners in the midst of all their wealth.
18~For all the power of sinners shall be destroyed; whilst that of the just shall be strengthened by the Lord.
19~“<l>Novit Dominus dies immaculatorum.</s>” The Lord watches over the days of innocent men, and he approves of their ways.
20~“<l>In tempore malo.</s>” In the time of divine vengeance. “<l>In diebus famis saturabuntur.</s>” When every one shall ardently desire his eternal salvation, they shall be satiated with joy by the benediction of God.
22~“<l>Justus autem miseretur, et tribuet.</s>” But the just, who has compassion on the poor, helps them, and will always have means to help them.
23~Those that bless God, as St. Augustine understands this, shall be blessed by God, and they shall inherit the land of the living; but those that curse him with blasphemies, shall be cursed and brought to ruin.
24~“<l>Viam ejus.</s>” His conduct, his ways.
25~If the just man happens to stumble, the Lord will not allow him to suffer hurt; for he himself, stretching out his hand, will support him.
27~All day long having compassion on the poor, he helps them, at least by lending to them; and therefore his family shall always see itself blessed by God.
28~“<l>Inhabita in sæculum sæculi.</s>” That is to say: Thou wilt be always happy.
31~“<l>Terram</s>” The land of the blessed.
32~“<l>Os justi meditabitur sapientiam.</s>” The words of the just man are always prudent and wise.
34~The wicked man sees that the life of the just man is opposed to his own, and through the hatred that he bears him he seeks to do him evil.
35~“<l>Nec damnabit eum, cum judicabitur illi.</s>” When he has to judge him, he will not condemn him, however great the calumnies laid to his charge by the wicked.
36~Wait, then, for the Lord, and continue to walk in the path by which he has led thee; he will exalt thee in such a manner as to make thee come to possess as thy inheritance the land that thou desirest; and when the wicked shall be lost, thou shalt see the recompense that God shall give to thee according to his promise.
38~“<l>Locus ejus.</s>” His greatness, of which there remained no more trace than if it had never been.
39~“<l>Sunt reliquiæ homini pacifico.</s>” St. Jerome translates: The remainder of the life of the meek man shall have true peace, which will accompany him even unto death. Others interpret the passage thus: His virtuous actions, besides his good name, will leave a good example, which after his death will continue to be useful to others and be a consolation which the good man will always enjoy. Both explanations are good.
40~“<l>Reliquiæ impiorum interibunt.</s>” The riches and the glory which the wicked thought of perpetrating on earth, all shall perish.
0~David bewails his sins. This psalm is suitable for every penitent that looks upon his sufferings and his tribulations as just chastisements of his sins, for which he begs pardon from God.
1~That is to say: Chastise me as a father, not as a judge; chastise me that I may amend, instead of being lost. See what is said in Psalm 2:5 and Psalm 5:1.
2~“<l>Sagittæ tuæ.</s>” Thy arrows, Thy chastisements. “<l>Confirmasti super me manum tuam.</s>” Justly hast Thou pressed heavily Thy hand upon me, loading me with trials.
3~At the sight of Thy anger, I have lost my health of body; and at the sight of my sins, I have lost peace, so that my bones are all trembling.
4~My iniquities are so many that they rise even higher than my head; and so grievous, that they weigh me down as a heavy burden.
5~“<l>A facie insipientiæ meæ.</s>” Because I have neglected to apply a timely remedy.
6~“<l>Curvatus sum usque in finem.</s>” I have remained utterly bent down towards the earth, so that I am scarcely able to raise my eyes to heaven.
7~“<l>Lumbi mei.</s>” That is to say: My concupiscence. “<l>Illusionibus.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Ardore</s>—A malignant heart.
8~I have been so afflicted and cast down, that the groans of my heart to heaven were like to the roarings of a lion.
10~My heart, or my will, has continued in trouble, since all strength has left me; and my eyes, that is, my mind, have lost the light, which made me see the truth.
11~They have drawn near, not to aid me, but to oppress me.
13~“<l>Vanitates.</s>” Falsehoods, calumnies, to destroy me.
17~I said within myself: Ah! may my enemies not have to rejoice over my ruin, since as my feet began to be unsteady, and they saw me tottering and likely to fall, they said great things at my expense, predicting my final overthrow.
18~Lord, I am prepared to suffer all the evils that Thou mayest send me; for my sorrow, that is to say, my sin which is the object of my sorrow, is ever before my eyes.
19~For I know and will always confess my fault; and I will ever think of my sin, that I may satisfy, as far as I can, my offended God, in order to obtain his forgiveness.
20~“<l>Confirmati sunt.</s>” They continue to arm themselves.
0~David speaks here of the pain that he felt and of the silence that he kept when Semei annoyed him with insults. The royal prophet at the same time exposes the reflections that his sins and the vain cares of men suggested to him. Finally, he represents himself as a pilgrim here on earth, and points out to sinners with what sentiments they should be animated in order to do penance.
1~I have resolved within myself that I will watch my ways that is, do my actions well; and therefore I have determined to be attentive not to sin with my tongue.
2~I have placed a guard upon my mouth, in order to be silent when some insolent person should provoke me with injurious words.
3~“<l>Silui a bonis.</s>” I refrained from reproaching my enemies with the good that I had done them. “<l>Dolor meus renovatus est.</s>” I felt my grief renewed in thinking that I had well deserved their injuries by my sins.
4~At the remembrance of my faults, confusion penetrated my heart; and in my meditation the heat of my pain was increased.
5~I said: Lord, make me know when Thy anger against me shall have an end; or, as others explain the passage, how near my end is.
6~Make known to me the number of my days, that I may know what is wanting to my penitences; or, according to others, how much longer I have to live.
7~“<l>Mensurabiles.</s>” St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>Breves</s>—Short. Measurable, or so short that they are easy to count. “<l>Substantia mea.</s>” My life, according to St. Jerome.
8~It is indeed true that every man who lives here on earth, with all the honors and riches that he possesses, is but mere vanity.
9~Man passes through life like a phantom; that is to say, all the joys that he thinks he finds on earth will turn out to be empty: it is, then, in vain that he should trouble himself about them and that he should seek to procure for himself such goods as will never satisfy the heart.
11~“<l>Substantia mea apud te est.</s>” All that I have, all my good, subsists in Thee, and depends on Thee, in whom are all my hopes. According to the Hebrew text: <l>Spes mea apud te est</s>—My hope is with Thee.
12~“<l>Opprobrium insipienti dedisti me.</s>” It is supposed that Semei is here meant, who treated David as a usurper of the throne.
13~I did not open my mouth to complain, because it was Thou that did this, or permitted this for my just punishment; I beseech Thee now to remove from me the other scourges that I have deserved.
15~Thou makest him waste away his life, as the spider spends itself in forming its fragile web; hence it is in vain that any man should trouble himself to lay up the goods of this world.
18~Before, then, I leave this world, where one day I shall be no longer, I beseech Thee to appease Thy just anger against me, that so I may find refreshment and relief.
0~St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, St. Augustine, and Euthymius see in this whole psalm only Jesus Christ and the holy Church, that is, the Head of his mystical body. And, in fact, in his Epistle to the Hebrews (10:5 <l>et seq.</s>) St. Paul applies to Jesus Christ certain verses of this psalm, which can really not be understood of David without counting several other passages which it would at least be difficult to apply to the holy king. If Jesus Christ addresses himself to his Father with so much humility and gratitude, it is because he speaks according to his humanity; he likewise speaks inasmuch as he is the Head of the predestined, and inasmuch as he has as man assumed our obligations towards God. And it is thus that, charged with our sins and as our established mediator between us and God, he prays, humbles himself, and trembles.
1~“<l>Expectans expectavi Dominum.</s>” I have waited a long time for the Lord as liberator and redeemer of his people. “<l>Intendit mihi.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Inclinavit se ad me</s>—He has inclined himself to me to listen to me.
2~“<l>De lacu miseriæ et de luto fæcis.</s>” These expressions denote, according to the Hebrew text, as Bellarmine remarks, a deep abyss, without light, filled with filthy mud, in which have fallen and flounder confusedly a miserable multitude; such are those that are plunged into the mire of their carnal appetites.
3~“<l>Super petram.</s>” That is to say: Upon myself, I who am the foundation-rock of the Church: <l>Petra autem erat Christus</s>—The rock was Christ (1 Cor. 10:4). “<l>Et direxit gressus meos.</s>” He placed my feet on a way that is not only solid, but also straight; and he thus guided my steps.
4~“<l>Canticum novum, carmen.</s>” A new canticle, a canticle of love, of thanksgiving, and of praise; according to the Hebrew, which would be <l>Laudem</s>—Praise, instead of <l>Carmen.</s>
5~Many shall see, or shall come to know, the misery of the pit in which they are, and shall have fear or horror of it; they shall then see their deliverer, and shall put their trust in the Lord.
6~“<l>Vanitates.</s>” Human supports, which are all vain. “<l>Insanias falsas.</s>” Earthly goods, from which it is only folly to hope for happiness.
7~“<l>Cogitationibus tuis.</s>” In the inventions of Thy love which Thou hast conceived and carried into effect for our good.
8~“<l>Multiplicati.</s>” Bellarmine thinks, according to the Hebrew text, that perhaps an error has here crept in, and that it should be: <l>Multiplicatæ (cogitationes tuæ)</s> or <l>Multiplicata (mirabilia tua)</s>—Thy thoughts or Thy marvels are multiplied. But St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, and St. Augustine say that the verse is to be read as it stands: <l>Multiplicati sunt super numerum;</s> this is to be understood of unbelievers who have been converted to follow Jesus Christ.
9~“<l>Sacrificium et oblationem noluisti.</s>” Thou hast refused the sacrifices and the offerings of the Law, which could not avail to purify the consciences. This means that God did not accept those sacrifices as sufficient to expiate for sin and to remove it from the soul; but that he accepted them only as figures of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Hence the Redeemer says: <l>Aures autem perfecisti mihi;</s> this St. Paul thus expresses: <l>Corpus autem aptasti mihi</s>—A body Thou hast fitted to me (Heb. 10:5). We must not deviate from this text of the Apostle, who by it explains that of David; so that it means: Thou hast formed for me a body fitted to suffer and to die.
10~“<l>Tunc dixi: Ecce venio.</s>” Then that is, on hearing Thy decree that I should assume human nature and offer myself on the cross as a sacrifice to atone for the sins of men I said: Behold I come to obey Thee.
11~“<l>In capite Libri.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In volumine Libri.</s> That is to say: In the volume of the Law. By this St. Ambrose understands the beginning of Genesis, where we read: <l>Quamobrem relinquet homo patrem suum et matrem, et adhærebit uxori suæ; et erunt duo in carne una</s>—Wherefore, a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh (Gen. 2:24). On this passage St. Paul comments thus: <l>Sacramentum hoc magnum est, ego autem dico in Christo et in Ecclesia</s>—This is a great sacrament, but I speak in Christ and in the Church (Eph. 5:32). According to St. Jerome it refers to the Gospel of St. John, which begins with these words: <l>In principio erat Verbum ... Et Verbum caro factum est</s>—In the beginning was the Word ... and the Word was made flesh. But Bellarmine thinks that the expression <l>In volumine Libri</s> denotes rather the whole volume of the Bible, which speaks throughout of the Messias who was to come, as say St. John Chrysostom and Theodoret, because Jesus Christ is the end of the Law. — St. Paul, after having said that God did not accept the ancient sacrifices that were offered for sin, quotes this text: <l>Tunc dixi: Ecce venio,</s> etc.—Then said I: Behold I come, etc. He then adds: <l>Aufert primum, ut sequens statuat. In qua voluntate sanctificati sumus per oblationem corporis Jesu Christi semel</s>—He taketh away the first, that he may establish that which followeth: in the which will we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ once (Heb. 10:7-10). He thus gives us to understand that by the one sacrifice of the cross, by which Jesus Christ delivered us from sin and sanctified us, all the ancient sacrifices were abolished.
12~I have made known Thy just law in a great assembly, that is, to a numerous people; and Thou knowest that I have done so, and that I shall continue to do so by myself till my death, and after death by means of my disciples.
13~I have preached publicly to a great multitude of people Thy justice and Thy truth, by which Thou renderest to every one to his works, and I have announced at the same time the salvation that Thou hast promised to him that hopes in Thee. “<l>Non abscondi in corde meo.</s>” In contrast with those that keep the truth shut up in their heart, and do not preach it through some human respect.
16~“<l>Comprehenderunt me iniquitates meæ.</s>” My sins have laid hold of me to afflict me with remorse, so that I am unable to look at them for horror.
17~My heart has abandoned, or failed me from sorrow.
21~“<l>Euge, euge.</s>” Well done, well done, we have made an end of him.
22~“<l>Salutare tuum.</s>” The salutation that they hope from Thee.
23~Although I see myself poor and miserable, I console myself with the thought that the Lord takes care of me, that is, of my salvation.
24~“<l>Ne tardaveris.</s>” Do not delay to help me when Thou seest me in danger.
0~This psalm, like the preceding, refers to the Passion of Jesus Christ; it is so interpreted by St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, St. Augustine, and particularly by St. John Chrysostom, who says that it would be rash to interpret it otherwise; for Jesus Christ himself, as we see in the Gospel of St. John (John 13:18), cites a verse of this Psalm (the 10th) to signify that the treason of Judas had long before been predicted by the prophet. This psalm speaks also of the mystical Body of Jesus Christ, of the Church.
1~Happy is he that devotes himself to the work of helping the poor, or whoever is in need of assistance; in the evil day, that is, the day of his death, the Lord will deliver him from all his trials.
2~“<l>Dominus conservet eum, et vivificet eum.</s>” The Lord will preserve him in the midst of dangers, and will so fortify him that he will come safe out of them. “<l>In animam.</s>” According to some Greek copies, as St. Ambrose remarks, it is: <l>In manus.</s> But Bellarmine justly observes that the sense is almost the same, except that the expression <l>In animam,</s> that is, <l>voluntatem, arbitrium</s>—to the will, or good pleasure, is more expressive than <l>In manus</s>—to the power.
3~At the time of his last illness the Lord will bring him help in his sufferings: Thou, O good Master, wilt prepare his couch, so that, reduced to extremity, he may find some alleviation.
4~“<l>Sana animam meam, quia peccavi tibi.</s>” Heal my soul, which has become sick through the offences that I have committed against Thee.
6~“<l>Vana loquebantur.</s>” He feigned a cordial compassion. “<l>Congregavit iniquitatem sibi.</s>” He consoled himself by redoubling his wicked hope of seeing me die.
7~He then went out to make others take part in his wickedness.
8~“<l>Adversum me cogitabant mala mihi.</s>” They united to plot against me, and to wish me all the evil that could befall me.
9~They are confirmed in their design upon my life, saying: Shall then he that dies think to return to life again?
10~This verse refers to the treason of Judas, according to what we read in the Gospel of St. John: “<l>Ut adimpleatur Scriptura: Qui manducat mecum panem, levabit contra me calcaneum suum</s>”—That the Scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth bread with me shall lift up his heel against me (John 13:18). “<l>Magnificavit super me supplantationem.</s>” He has made it his boast to complete my ruin by offering to give me up into the hands of my enemies.
11~“<l>Resuscita me; et retribuam eis.</s>” Prediction of the resurrection of Jesus Christ: After I shall be dead on the cross, make me rise again; and then, as judge, I shall inflict upon them the punishment that they deserve. The Son of God here prays his Father to raise him up again, because he is praying as a servant; but he was well able for that matter to raise up his body again by his own power, as the Word of the Father and true God equal to his Father. This is what in fact happened, as he himself declared: <l>Potestatem habeo ponendi eam (animam meam), et Potestatem habeo iterum sumendi eam</s>—I have power to lay down my life; and I have power to take it up again (John 10:18).
12~“<l>Super me.</s>” Over me, on account of my death.
13~On account of my innocence, Thou hast defended me from my enemies, and Thou hast placed me in heaven at Thy right hand for all eternity. This happened at the Ascension of Jesus Christ.
14~“<l>Fiat, fiat.</s>” In the Hebrew: <l>Amen, amen.</s> So be it; let all be for his praise and glory.
0~Forced to fly from Saul, David is full of sadness in finding himself far from the Tabernacle; he consoles himself with the hope of seeing it again; at the same time he fosters the desire of enjoying the sight of God in the Temple of Heaven after his exile upon earth. This should be the desire of every Christian living in this world at a distance from his heavenly country. He should desire without ceasing for the moment when he can go to see face to face the God of his love.
2~“<l>Deum fortem.</s>” The God Almighty. “<l>Vivum.</s>” The living God, very different from the gods of the Gentiles, who are dead gods.
3~“<l>Dum dicitur mihi quotidie: Ubi est Dens tuus!</s>” As I hear my enemies continually saying to me in my affliction: Where then is now thy God, in whom thou so much hopest to console thee?
4~I remembered these reproaches, and I poured out my soul, that is to say, I emptied or stripped it of all earthly affections, with the sweet thought that I should one day pass from this exile to the admirable tabernacle in which God has established his abode.
5~“<l>Sonus epulantis.</s>” Then I shall take part in the banquet of the blessed, whose voice resounds with the ceaseless songs of joy and thanksgiving.
7~Have confidence in God; for with his help I hope to go one day to heaven, there to celebrate his mercy and say to him: Thou art my God and the salvation of my face, that is to say, my Saviour always present to my eyes: Thou causest my face to see Thy face.
8~“<l>Memor ero tui.</s>” To console myself, I will always think of Thee in whatever place I am.
9~One abyss of ills invites another, which pours down upon me with a crash. David speaks here of the tribulations or temptations that came upon him like billows raised by a storm with terrific roaring.
10~All the waters of the heavens and all the floods of trials with which Thou triest Thy servants, seem to have passed over me.
11~In the day time, or at the time of my consolations, the Lord has made me taste of the sweetness of his mercy; but now in this night of tribulations he wills that, resigned to his will, I cease not to sing his praises and to bless him.
12~Therefore my prayer to God, the author and the preserver of my life, shall be continual in my heart; I will always say to him: Lord Thou art my protector, do not abandon me.
13~“<l>Quare oblitus es mei?</s>” But why dost Thou deal with me as if Thou hadst forgotten me?
15~Repetition of verses 3 and 6.
16~Repetition of verse 7.
0~David begs of God to be delivered from his enemies, and consoles himself with the hope of again seeing the Tabernacle of the Lord. In the spiritual sense this psalm applies to the just man who in the trials of the present life longs to leave this world, and to go to his heavenly country.
1~“<l>De gente non sancta.</s>” Against the wicked who persecute me.
2~“<l>Quare me repulisti?</s>” Why dost Thou seem to have cast me off?
3~Send forth Thy light, and make me enjoy Thy promises; they will bring me out of sadness, and will lead me to Thy holy mountain of Sion, and to Thy tabernacle. “<l>Deduxerunt et adduxerunt.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Deducent et adducent.</s>
4~Having entered therein, I will approach the divine altar, and even to my God, who will restore to me the gladness that rejoiced my youth.
5~“<l>Confitebor tibi.</s>” There I will sing Thy praises. “<l>Quare tristis es, anima mea?</s>” Why, my soul, having such a hope, art thou sad?
6~Have confidence in thy God, for I hope to go one day to bless him and to thank him forever in heaven, while saying to him: Thou art my God and the salvation of my face, that is, Thou my Saviour wilt be ever present to my eyes, and to see Thy beautiful face will be my salvation and beatitude.
0~What dominates in this psalm is the expression of the sentiments which should animate the just amid the afflictions of the present life. The psalmist, therefore, proposes to us a prayer that we should address to God in the time of tribulation.
3~Thy powerful arm scattered the idolatrous nations that dwelt in the land of promise, and there Thou didst establish our fathers.
5~But all was the work of Thy power, because Thou didst look upon them with a gracious eye, and Thou wast pleased to favor them.
6~“<l>Qui mandas salutes Jacob.</s>” Thou who providest for the salvation of Jacob, that is to say, of Thy people who descend from Jacob.
7~“<l>Inimicos nostros ventilabimus cornu.</s>” We shall scatter our enemies.
12~“<l>Avertisti nos retrorsum post inimicos nostros.</s>” Thou hast subjected us to our enemies, so that they have made us their prisoners, and we are forced to follow them.
14~Thou hast allowed Thy people to be sold for nothing; and there was none among the multitude who offered a price for the men of Thy people because they despised them as not worth buying.
20~“<l>Declinasti semitas nostras.</s>” It is generally thought that the negative participle <l>Non,</s> which is found in the first part of the verse, is wanting here. St. Jerome translates the passage thus: <l>Non declinaverunt semitæ nostræ.</s> Hence the meaning of it is: Thou hast not permitted our steps to wander from Thy way.
21~“<l>In loco afflictionis.</s>” To the depth of misery. St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>In locum draconum</s>—To a place of dragons, which means a place of horrors. “<l>Umbra mortis.</s>” The shadow of death, after which darkness alone remains; this denotes a great obscurity.
25~“<l>Quare obdormis?</s>” Why dost Thou make as though Thou sleepest, and takest no more care of us?
27~We see ourselves humbled and despised as the dust that is trodden under foot; hence, prostrate with our faces to the earth, we implore Thy mercy.
28~“<l>Redime nos propter nomen tuum.</s>” Deliver us from so many evils for the glory of Thy name.
0~A canticle in honor of Jesus Christ and of the Church, his Spouse. The prophet plainly announces the mystery of the Incarnation of the Word and the victory which the Redeemer was to gain over the world.
1~My heart, full of divine illuminations, breaks out in holy words, and utters this hymn in honor of my King, who is the Messias.
2~My tongue is as the pen in the hand of a rapid writer, who writes all that is dictated to him by the Holy Spirit.
3~Thou, my King and my Saviour.
5~“<l>Specie tua et pulchritudine tua.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Gloria tua et decore tuo.</s> “<l>Intende.</s>” Go forward. “<l>Prospere procede, et regna.</s>” Do not cease to advance from victory to victory, and establish Thy reign in the world.
6~Reign with truth, that is, with fidelity to Thy promises, with the meekness that Thou usest towards sinners, and with the justice that Thou exercisest in judging the obstinate; thus will Thy power lead Thee on wonderfully to extend Thy kingdom.
7~The people, conquered by Thy arrows, or by the rays of Thy light which has power to penetrate hearts, will fall and submit themselves to Thee, so that Thy enemies, who before despised Thee, shall be brought to adore Thee.
8~Thus, O God, Saviour of the world! Thy throne, or Thy reign, unlike the temporal reigns of other kings, shall be eternal in the Church; and Thy rod, that is, Thy sceptre or Thy government, shall ever be most just. — “<l>Virga directionis</s>” means the same as <l>Virga rectissima.</s>
9~“<l>Præ consortibus tuis.</s>” That is, Exalting Thee, so as to make Thee sit at his right hand a glory that surpasses that of all the men and angels who shall be with Thee in heaven. It is here said that Jesus Christ is anointed or constituted King of the world. This is to be understood, not of his divinity, but of his humanity. We are to understand also that he is anointed with the unction of grace as Head of the faithful, who through his merits shall receive graces from God.
10~“<l>A vestimentis tuis, a domibus eburneis.</s>” Here by the garments and by the ivory houses is to be understood the most sacred humanity of the Redeemer. Hence the verse is thus explained: From Thy humanity comes the odor of most pure and sweet perfumes; an odor that leads the daughters of the kings, or great souls, to rejoice Thee by running to adore Thee.
11~“<l>Regina.</s>” By this Queen is understood the Church, and we may also understand the Mother of God, or every holy soul that is a spouse of Jesus Christ, and therefore a queen, as St. Bernard says: <l>Singulæ animæ singulæ sponsæ</s>—Every soul, a spouse.
12~Then is said to this Queen: “<l>Vide, et inclina aurem tuam.</s>” Behold the honor to which thou art raised, and listen to that which thou hast to do.
13~The King shall love thy beauty, he who is thy Spouse, whom alone thou shouldst love, since he is the Lord, thy God, and whom in the end all must adore.
14~This is addressed only to the Church: The daughters of Tyre, that is, the Gentile nations, shall honor thee with gifts and offerings; among them shall be seen all the great ones of the people prostrating themselves before thee, to implore thy protection.
15~Her glory should consist in interior virtues of the soul, more than in exterior ornaments or in what is manifest to others.
16,17~In the train of the Spouse many virgins shall be brought to the King in his temple; but they shall be those only that are her nearest, that is, united with the Queen and Spouse, who is the Church, according to the explanation of St. Basil and St. Augustine.
18~According to St. Basil, St. John Chrysostom, St. Jerome, and St. Augustine, these words are addressed to the Church, and their sense is: O Spouse of the Saviour! instead of the fathers of old, the patriarchs and the prophets, who are now no more, there are born to thee sons, the apostles, the disciples and their successors, whom thou hast constituted princes over the whole earth; for by their preaching the Gospel thou hast subjected all the nations to thy obedience.
19~O Lord! these apostles, these disciples and their successors in every age, shall continue to preach throughout all generations Thy name, that is, Thy power and Thy mercy towards men. “<l>Memores erunt.</s>” Many, according to the present Hebrew text and the Greek version, read: <l>Memor ero</s>—I shall remember. But St. Jerome and St. Augustine follow the Vulgate.
20~Therefore the nations, converted to the faith, will never cease to adore Thee.
0~St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, St. Augustine, St. John Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Euthymius, unanimously teach that this psalm is to be understood of the Catholic Church with regard to the victories that she has gained over her persecutors, and her stability under the protection of God.
3~“<l>Eorum.</s>” Bossuet with St. Jerome, following the Hebrew, reads: <l>Ejus.</s>
4~In the midst of these storms, the Lord will cause to flow down a river of peace which shall rejoice the city of God, that is, the holy Church, which the Most High has chosen for his temple by sanctifying it with his grace.
5~God will always remain with her, assisting her from the first dawn of the morning, that is, from the moment of its birth.
6~“<l>Inclinata.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Concussa</s>—Shaken. When the Church was established the nations were troubled and the kingdoms were shaken.
7~For ourselves we have no cause to fear, privileged as we are.
10~“<l>Vacate.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Cessate.</s> Therefore you who are my servants leave alone your earthly cares and employ yourselves in reflecting that I alone myself am God, for whom all things exist, and upon whom all things depend; a day will come when I shall be exalted, that is, acknowledged as the sovereign Lord of the universe, by the nations and through the whole earth.
11~Repetition of verse 7 for the conclusion, that is to say: Let us then rejoice that we his faithful servants have on our side to protect us this great, all-powerful God.
0~This psalm presents two literal senses: In the first, it refers to the triumph of the Ark when it was carried to Mount Sion (2 Kings 6:15); in the second sense, it is applied, according to the opinion of several of the holy Fathers, to the glorious Ascension of Jesus Christ into heaven.
2~He is the Lord, supreme above all by his majesty, terrible to all by his power; he is the great Monarch who holds dominion over the whole earth.
4~Among all the nations, he has chosen us to be his especial inheritance, because we are the children of Jacob, whom he so much loved.
5~“<l>Ascendit Deus.</s>” Our Lord ascends to heaven by his own power, because he is God.
7~“<l>Psallite sapienter.</s>” Render to him (wisely) the praises that he deserves, and as he deserves.
8~He shall reign as God over all nations; as God he shall sit upon his heavenly throne, at the right of the eternal Father.
9~“<l>Principes populorum congregati sunt cum Deo Abraham.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Congregati sunt, populus Dei Abraham</s>—The princes of the Gentile people are united with the people of the God of Abraham. “<l>Quoniam dii fortes terra vehementer elevati sunt.</s>” This passage is very obscure. Some, as Mattei and Genebrard, say that by the Hebrew word <l>Elohim</s> (the plural for the singular) <l>Dii fortes terra,</s> God himself is to be understood, and they explain the words thus: <l>Deus victoria elevatus est</s>—God is exalted in victory. But St. Cyril, Theodoret, and Didymus, understand by the words <l>Dii fortes terræ</s>—The princes of the earth. This agrees with the translation of St. Jerome: <l>Dii scuta terræ,</s> that is to say: The gods, the shields of the earth, that is, Protectors, those that have subjects under them. “<l>Elevati sunt.</s>” They have become exalted by being united in worshipping the true God. This last explanation pleases me more, because it is more in conformity with the Vulgate and the version of the Septuagint. The passage, then, may be thus explained: The princes, who are the protectors or rulers of the earth, have been greatly elevated by uniting in the worship of God.
0~In the literal sense this psalm is to be understood of the protection of God over the earthly Jerusalem; and in the figurative sense, of the care with which he watches over the spiritual Jerusalem, that is, over his Church.
1~“<l>In civitate Dei nostri, in monte sancto ejus.</s>” In the city of Jerusalem, and especially on the holy mountain of Sion, where our God makes his glory shine forth.
3~God shall be known among the inhabitants of this city, when he shall defend it against the attacks of its enemies.
4~“<l>Convenerunt in unum.</s>” They have assembled for the purpose of laying it waste.
5~“<l>Ipsi videntes sic admirati sunt.</s>” On seeing that the hand of the Omnipotent protects it, they are seized with great astonishment.
6~They shall suffer pains like those that a woman endureth in childbirth: Thou, O Lord! wilt raise stormy winds, which shall break in pieces the ships of Tharsis; that is, the largest ships, such as those that sailed to Tharsis.
7~Mark now what the inhabitants of Jerusalem will say: What was promised us we have with our own eyes seen verified in the city of our God, who has made its foundations everlasting. This has indeed been verified in the Church, of which it is said: <l>Et portæ inferi non prævalebunt adversus eam</s>—The gates of hell shall not prevail against her (Matt. 16:18).
8~“<l>In medio templi tui.</s>” In Thy Church, and in the sight of the whole world.
9~As Thou hast made known, O Lord! Thy great name throughout the earth, so everywhere has Thy glory been proclaimed; and so also has Thy power been praised, which is always full of justice in rewarding the good and in punishing the wicked.
10~“<l>Propter judicia tua.</s>” On account of the just judgments that Thou, O Lord! dost exercise on earth.
11~Come, O nations! come all of you to dwell round about Sion so that she may be in the midst of you; then preach the Gospel from her towers, that is, publicly. “<l>Narrate in turribus ejus.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Numerate turres ejus</s>—Count the high towers that defend her.
12~Apply yourselves to consider her strength, and distribute or assign to the different inhabitants, or workmen, the places destined for the construction of their houses, that is, of their particular churches, so that when the city is built up and filled with a faithful people, we may transmit to posterity the knowledge of the true God.
0~The psalmist here addresses the faithful, to teach them to despise the goods of this world and to fear only a bad death which must be followed by the sentence of condemnation. Then he raises their thoughts to the consideration of this truth, that only in God can true happiness be found. Of course, all this is said in an obscure manner; but thanks to the light of the Gospel, we are able to see the thought of the prophet.
3~I shall speak to you only of the things that it is necessary to know; I will tell you what I have meditated in my heart, that you may know how to act prudently in all that you do.
4~I shall attentively hear the truths that are proposed to me in parable; and this enigma I will explain to you to the sound of the harp. “<l>Propositionem meam.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Ænigma meum.</s>
5~Why should I fear on the evil day, that is, on the day of my judgment? Only my iniquity makes me fear, especially the iniquity of my heel; that is, that which shall follow me unto death, which is the end of my life, as the heel is the end of my body.
7~“<l>Frater non redimit, redimet homo.</s>” <l>Non</s> is again understood before <l>homo,</s> according to the usage of Scripture, as Bellarmine remarks. The sense, then, is: At the moment of death their brother will be unable to deliver them from the peril; and much less will any other man be able to do so.
9~“<l>Non videbit interitum.</s>” These words, according to Bossuet, are to be understood in an ironical sense as if the prophet said: <l>An putabit se non visurum interitum?</s>—Will he suppose that he will not see death? Others give this interpretation: He shall not see death, that is, he shall not die before having finished the natural course of his life, although he sees wise men die. Or, as Bellarmine says, we may understand the passage to mean: He shall neglect to provide for death, which is waiting for him at its time; for the sinners avoid thinking of death; but alike for the fool as for the wise, there must come a day when they must die.
11~It is there that they shall dwell for several generations; there shall be nothing left of them in their lands but their names written on tablets of marble, or on the walls of their houses.
12~“<l>Non intellexit.</s>” He did not understand what he should have understood as man.
13~“<l>Hæc via illorum scandalum ipsis.</s>” Such is their way, that is, their life, in which they find many dangerous occasions that may bring them to ruin.
14~These miserable men, living like animals without reason, they will one day find themselves as victims of divine justice, cast into hell, where death shall feed on them; that is, where their death will be eternal. As sheep feed upon the blades of grass, and leave the roots to sprout forth again, so death torments unceasingly the reprobate, still leaving them life, that they may go on suffering eternally.
15~At the general resurrection, which is “morning,” or the beginning of the age to come, the wicked shall see the just established their masters and their judges; then the power which they had in this world will be shattered and destroyed in hell, after all the vain glory of which they boasted during their life. “<l>Auxilium.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Robur, potestas.</s>
16~“<l>Cum acceperit me.</s>” When he shall receive me among his servants, after having completed the work of Redemption.
18~“<l>Non sumet omnia.</s>” A Hebraism: He shall take nothing away with him.
19~The sinner shall be blessed, that is, applauded by worldlings during his life upon earth; while he will not praise you, save when you load him with earthly goods.
20~After his wicked life this wicked man shall go into the abode of his ancestors, whose bad example he has followed, and there he will remain forever, never more to see the light.
21~Repetition of verse 12 for the conclusion.
0~This psalm describes the second coming of Jesus Christ, which will be public and full of majesty, in contrast with his first coming, which was humble and hidden.
1~The God of gods, the true God, the Sovereign Master of all created powers, has cited before his tribunal all men of the earth to give an account of their lives.
2~He will make his voice heard from one extremity of the earth to the other; and he shall come down from the heavenly Sion, adorned with his glory and majesty.
3~Our God shall come in sight of the whole world, and make himself known as the great God that he is; and then he shall no longer be silent, as he has been in the past, seeing the sins of the wicked, while seeming not to notice the injury that he received.
4~The fire at his presence will burn with greater force, reducing the world to ashes, according to the words of St. Peter: <l>Terra autem, et quæ in ipsa sunt opera, exurentur</s>—The earth and the works which are in it shall be burnt up (2 Peter 3:10). And around him there shall be a great and universal tempest, which shall throw everything into confusion on earth, in the sea, and in the air.
5~He will then call heaven and earth, that is, all the angels and all men, to be present at the judgment that he will make of his people, by separating the elect from the reprobate.
6~Angels of heaven, gather around the Sovereign Judge his saints, that is, the elect; who besides sacrifices, that is, besides external worship, have kept his covenant by obeying his law.
7~“<l>Deus judex est.</s>” The judge is God; he cannot err.
8~Here the prophet makes Jesus Christ speak and say: Listen, my people, to what I shall say to thee; listen, Israel, that is, all the true faithful, to what I shall declare to thee, through my inspirations and by my ministers; thou shouldst believe me, for I am thy God, the true God, who knows all things, and who loves thee.
9~My people, I will not reproach thee for the sacrifices that thou hast neglected to offer to me; for those that thou hast offered me suffice me, and they are ever before my eyes.
12~I well know that all the birds are mine, and that which gives richness and beauty to the fields is mine.
15~If thou wouldst please me, offer to me, thy God, a sacrifice of praise, which comes not only from the lips, but from a heart that loves me, and fulfil the promises that thou hast made to me.
16~“<l>Honorificabis me.</s>” Thou shalt honor me by returning me thanks.
17~We read in St. Jerome’s translation: <l>Quid tibi est cum narratione præceptorum meorum, et ut assumas pactum meum in ore tuo?</s> The verse may, therefore, be thus explained: The Lord says to the sinner: Of what use is it to talk of my precepts, when thou dost not observe them, and of my covenant, when thou art wanting to it on thy part?
18~“<l>Disciplinam.</s>” That is, my teaching.
21~“<l>Ponebas scandalum.</s>” St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>Fabricabaris opprobrium.</s> The sense of the verse is: Sitting in company with others, thou hast spoken ill of thy neighbor; thou hast sought to take away the good name of thy own brother; this thou hast done, and I have been silent.
22~Didst thou think, O wicked man! that I was like to thee? and that I should take no account of thy offences against me? but the time will come when I shall bring up against thee thy wicked life, and I will take care that thy crimes may ever be before thy eyes, that their very hideousness may ever be thy torment.
23~“<l>Nequando rapiat.</s>” That so you may avoid being made one day the prey of the devil.
24~Remember that the sacrifice of praise, that is, a good life, is the only sacrifice that honors me; and this is the way by which I give thee to understand that thou wilt obtain salvation, which consists in the enjoyment of the sight of God, and in loving him for all eternity.
0~David, contrite and humbled, bewails his sins. In this psalm is perfectly expressed the sorrow that a sinner feels when repenting of his faults he humbly asks God’s pardon. It is the fourth penitential psalm.
1~Show to me great mercy because I am a great sinner.
2~“<l>Dele iniquitatem meam.</s>” Blot out from my soul all my sins.
4~I well know the enormity of my sin, which is continually before my eyes, reproaching me with the evil that I have done.
5~O Lord, against Thee alone I have sinned, and I have dared to do evil before Thy eyes; but I hope to receive from Thee the pardon which Thou hast promised to repentant sinners so that Thou mayest be justified in Thy words. <l>In sermonibus tuis,</s> that is, in regard to Thy promises to pardon him who repents, and that Thou wilt overcome, that is, Thou wilt shut the mouth of my enemies, who think and dare to say that it is not just that I should receive pardon for so great a sin, when Thou shalt judge me. It must be remarked that this verse is variously explained by others. “<l>Tibi soli peccavi.</s>” Bellarmine, Tirinus, and Mattei, following the commentary of St. Cyril and of St. Gregory, explain thus: <l>Tibi soli peccavi ut judici</s>—Against Thee only have I sinned as Judge. I have sinned against Thee alone, in this sense, that Thou alone art to judge me; for though it is true that I have also sinned against my neighbor by causing the death of Urias and by scandalizing the people, nevertheless I am afraid of Thee alone; because as king I have no one on earth to judge me, and yet I have to be judged, and by Thee alone be punished, and not by men. This commentary is beautiful, but the interpretation given above appears to me more simple and more appropriate: “Lord against Thee alone I have sinned,” for it was God’s law only that David transgressed. It is no objection that he had also offended against Urias and the people; for these offences were sins only so far as they were transgressions of the law of God, since all the malice of sin consists in the transgression of the divine law, according to what the Apostle says: “<l>Peccatum non cognovi, nisi per legem.</s>”—But I did not know sin, but by the law (Rom. 7:7). Hence David said with good reason: Against Thee only I have sinned; for Thy law alone I have transgressed. “<l>Ut justificeris.</s>” Theodoret says that the particle <l>Ut</s> does not here signify cause but consequence. “<l>Judicaris.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Judicaveris</s>—Thou shalt judge.
6~I have had the misfortune of being conceived in sin; when my mother conceived me I appeared in the world already a sinner.—As if he would say: what, O Lord! couldst Thou expect, from a man conceived in sin?—Grotius explains this passage thus: I was guilty from my birth. But this interpretation seems to favor the opinion of Socinus, who denied original sin, and denied that it was contracted from the moment of conception; whereas this text proves perhaps more clearly than any other that all men are conceived in original sin.
7~Thou lovest the truth, and him also who confesses his fault: I confess my ingratitude, inasmuch as Thou hast favored me by making known to me the secrets of Thy wisdom, secrets uncertain and hidden to others.
8~Reference is here made to the sprinkling of the blood of the victims, which was made over the lepers with hyssop to purify them (Levit. 14:6). That is to say: Cleanse me, O Lord! ever more and more.
9~In making me hear that Thou hast pardoned me, Thou wilt give to my soul a joy and gladness so great that my very bones, that is, all my interior powers, which have been so greatly afflicted, shall leap for joy.
10~My God, turn, then, Thy face from my sins, that is, look no longer upon them; and blot out from my soul all my faults, which gave Thee horror.
11~Change my heart, and give me a pure heart, that loves none but Thee: and renew within my bowels, that is, my interior, that right spirit which I had lost by sin.
13~Restore to me the joy of the salvation which Thou hast given me, and confirm me in good by means of a principal spirit, that is, one that is strong, inspired by Thee.
14~I promise Thee, on account of the scandal that I have given, to instruct sinners in Thy law, and I hope that they will be converted to Thee.
15~“<l>Sanguinibus.</s>” Rotigni and Lallemant give to this word a sense that is very probable, by explaining it to refer to the remorse of conscience with which David was afflicted on account of the blood of Urias.—“<l>Justitiam tuam.</s>” Bellarmine says that the pardon of sin is mercy with respect to us; but that it is justice with regard to Jesus Christ who, by his death, has merited for us pardon; and this is the divine justice of which David meant to speak.
17~If to satisfy for my sins Thou hadst required of me sacrifices, I would willingly have offered them to Thee; but I well know that with holocausts Thou art not satisfied.
18~The sacrifice that is pleasing to Thee, O my God! is a soul afflicted on account of its sin; when a heart is contrite and humbled Thou knowest not how to despise it.
19~That is: If I do not deserve to be heard, look, O Lord! with a gracious eye upon Thy city Sion, and according to Thy good-will, that is, in accordance with the purpose of Thy good pleasure, which Thou hadst in choosing it as Thy dwelling-place, show to it Thy favor, so that the walls of Jerusalem, now fallen in ruins, may be rebuilt.
20~Then wilt Thou accept with joy my sacrifices of justice, that is, as Bellarmine understands it, my homage justly due to Thee, and all my offerings and holocausts; and many, after my example, will offer to Thee upon Thy altar, calves, that is, choice victims, amongst which the calf was the noblest.
0~This psalm, taken in a literal sense, shows us David reproaching Doeg, the Edomite, for having excited against him and against the priest Achimelech the anger of Saul, and for having thus caused the ruin of many others (1 Kings 1:22). In the mystical sense, Doeg represents all the wicked that persecute the good.
1~“<l>In iniquitate.</s>” In doing injury to others.
2~All the time thou hast employed thy tongue only to offend others unjustly; thou hast used it as a well-sharpened razor to deceive.
3~Thou hast loved to do evil to thy neighbor better than to do him good: thou hast sought to speak to his damage more readily than to his advantage.
5~“<l>Radicem tuam.</s>” He will make thee disappear with all thy race, as a tree is felled and pulled up with all its roots.
6~The just shall see all this, and they will have horror thereat; at the same time they will laugh at his ruin, and will say: Behold the man who refused to put his trust in God, as if he did not need his help.
7~“<l>Prævaluit in vanitate sua.</s>” He reckoned on his vain supports, which gave him a promise of happiness.
9~I will never cease to thank Thee for Thy benefits; and in all my tribulations I will wait for the help of Thy goodness, which never fails to succor Thy servants.
0~The psalmist deplores the corruption of mankind, and prays God to deliver his people from the persecution of the wicked. He speaks also of God’s goodness in waiting for sinners to do penance; and at the same time he sighs for the coming of the Redeemer to deliver man from the slavery of the devil, typified by the captivity of Babylon.
1~“<l>Insipiens.</s>” The impious man becomes a fool by his impiety. A man must have lost his reason to think that there is no God.
2~Miserable men! living a life of moral corruption, they have become abominable by their iniquity before God and before men; there is not one among them who does a good action.
3~“<l>Intelligent, aut requirens Deum.</s>” Who understands his duty, and seeks to please God.
4~“<l>Omnes declinaverunt, simul inutiles facti sunt.</s>” All are wanting to their duty, and thus render themselves useless to God and to men.
5~Will these unhappy men then never know their perversity, and will they continue to oppress my people with as much ease as one eats bread?
6~The cause of their wicked life comes from their not wishing to call upon the Lord in the dangers of offending him; they fear where there is no cause for fear, that is, they fear to lose some earthly good, and they are not afraid of losing the grace of God.
7~God will utterly destroy those that displease him in order to please men; they shall be confounded; for as they despise God, so also shall they be despised by God.
8~The fools will say: Who will come from Sion to save Israel? But when God shall turn the slavery of his people into glorious liberty, this same people shall be filled with joy.
0~Prayer that David addresses to God to deliver him from the soldiers of Saul by whom he was surrounded. This psalm may serve for all Christians that find themselves assailed by the temptations of the devil. We may remark with Cardinal Bellarmine that the holy Church wishes to teach us how to arm ourselves with prayer against the tribulations and temptations that may assail us every day.
1~Save me, by the virtue and for the glory of Thy holy name, from the danger in which I am; judge me according to my innocence, and according to Thy power, which protects the innocent.
3~My own fellow-countrymen have separated themselves from me and, as foreign enemies, have armed themselves against me, in order to take away my life, having lost sight of God‘s justice.
4~“<l>Ecce enim.</s>” But I already know that, etc.
5~“<l>Averte mala.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Revertatur malum</s>—May evil return. Make, O God! to retort upon my enemies the evil that they have planned for me; scatter them according to Thy promises, which are always faithful and true.
6~Then with ready heart will I offer Thee sacrifices; and I will praise Thy holy name, so full of goodness to him that invokes Thee.
7~Through Thy mercy I find myself delivered by Thy hand from all anxiety, and my eyes shall be able to see with scorn my enemies cast down.
0~David, persecuted by his son Absalom, and imploring the help of God: such, in the literal sense, is the subject of this psalm. But St. Hilary and St. Jerome apply this psalm to Jesus Christ, betrayed by Judas and persecuted by the Jews. Generally speaking, it may be applied to all the just, persecuted in this life by men or devils.
1~“<l>Intende mihi.</s>” Consider my tribulation.
2~I am afflicted in applying myself to consider my sufferings, and I am troubled at hearing of the persecution that my perverse enemy is plotting against me.
3~My enemies have accused me of crimes that I have not committed; and moved by anger, they seek all means to hurt me.
5~“<l>Contexerunt me tenebræ.</s>” I am encompassed all around with darkness, so that I am unable to see any escape from the dangers that threaten me.
6~In this state I said: Who will give me wings, that like a timid dove, as I am at present, I may be able to fly and seek repose in some secure place?
7~I would take flight if I could, and I should be content to remain in some unknown desert. This is the explanation given by Rotigni and Lallemant.
8~There I would wait for him who has so often delivered me from my great fear of soul, and from the tempest that arose against me.
9~Cast down those that seek to oppress me; confound their tongues, that is, put discord between them, so that their designs become fruitless; for I see their iniquity; I see the whole city in contradiction, that is, all in disorder and confusion.
14~But he that persecutes me, who is he? It is thou, my guide and my friend, who I believed had but one and the same heart with me.
19~At all times, I will publish the mercy of the Lord in assisting me, and I hope that he will ever graciously hearken to my prayers.
20~He will establish me again in my former peace, and will deliver my life from those that approach me to oppress me; for they have come in great numbers against me to cast me down. This is according to the translation of St. Jerome, who has: <l>Multi enim fuerunt adversum me.</s>
21~“<l>Qui est ante sæcula.</s>” He who is the Eternal.
22~The Lord sees that for them there is no change, that is, he sees that they are obstinate, and that they have no fear of God; and for this reason he has already raised his hand to punish them according to their malice.
23~“<l>Contaminaverunt testamentum ejus.</s>” They have violated his covenant. St. Jerome translates: <l>Contaminavit pactum suum,</s> that is, they have broken their given faith. “<l>Divisi sunt ab ira vultus ejus.</s>” But they have been scattered at the sight of the anger which the Lord showed against them. “<l>Appropinquavit cor illius.</s>” The heart of God has drawn near, that is, is set to take on them his just vengeance. Others refer the words <l>cor illius,</s> not to God, but to the rebellious. They say that such a rebel or traitor has one thing on his lips and another in his heart. But, according to Bellarmine, here is signified the heart of God aroused to anger.
24~“<l>Ipsi sunt jacula.</s>” In reality their words are sharp arrows hurled when least expected.
25~But the Lord encourages me to leave to his goodness the care of my salvation, and thus he will take thought to preserve my life; he will not permit that the just man should always be tossed about on the billows of fear.
26~On the contrary, O Lord! as for my enemies, Thou wilt cast them down into the pit of death, that is, into hell, where has to be endured a never-ending death. Hell is called a pit, because it has a mouth to receive the damned, but has no door by which they can go out.
0~David flying from the presence of Saul, who was seeking his death, retires among the Philistines; but when recognized by them who he was, he finds himself in great danger (1 Kings 21:10). Under these circumstances he composes this prayer, which every Christian can use when he sees himself in danger of falling into sin and becoming the prey of the devil.
1~The man, who is my enemy, has sought to tread me under foot; and therefore persecuting me the whole day, he has striven to afflict me.
2~All my enemies have united to plot continually my ruin.
3~“<l>Ab altitudine diei.</s>” Many, as Menochius, understand hereby the great dangers that threaten; but I prefer the interpretation of Calmet and Tirinus, which is more literal. According to it the verse is explained thus: During the whole day, from the rising of the sun, I am in a continual fear; but I hope from Thee, O Lord! the help that I need.
4~“<l>Sermones meos.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Verbum ejus.</s> The promises that he has made me, or the word that he has given me. “<l>Caro.</s>” The carnal man, who in regard to God is but weakness (see verse 11).
7~“<l>Sustinuerunt animam meam.</s>” They have waited for the opportunity to take away my life. “<l>Pro nihilo salvos facies illos.</s>” So Thou wilt on no account save them. This is St. Jerome’s explanation. St. Augustine, on the contrary, gives this interpretation: Thou wilt save them, of pure grace, without any merit on their part. The sense of St. Jerome agrees better with the words that follow: “<l>In ira populos confringes.</s>” In Thy just wrath, Thou wilt break to pieces this crowd of enemies who would destroy me.
8~I lay before Thee all the afflictions of my life; I hope that Thou wilt always have my tears before Thy eyes.
9~As Thou hast promised, I hope that my enemies, filled with confusion, at seeing their designs brought to naught, will turn backwards.
10~I shall not fail to call upon Thee every day; for I have well known that Thou art my God, coming to my assistance, as Thou hast every time that I have called on Thee.
11~I shall always praise in my God and my Lord his faithfulness to his promises; and therefore, trusting in him, I will not fear that man can do me any harm (see verse 4).
12~This is the explanation that Bellarmine gives with St. Jerome: In me, that is, in my memory are always “<l>Vota tua</s>” the promises that I have made to Thee; hence I will never cease to offer to Thee the praises and the thanksgivings that are contained in these promises.
13~“<l>Ut placeam coram Deo in lumine viventium.</s>” In order that I may be well pleasing to Thee by means of the light of grace, whereby Thy servants live in the fidelity to Thee.
0~The psalmist here manifests his confidence in the protection of God, whose praises he proclaims.
2~“<l>Donec transeat iniquitas.</s>” Until the time when I see the end of the unjust persecution that I suffer.
5~God sent from heaven the mercy that he had promised me, and he saved my life by withdrawing me from the midst of my enemies who like young lions were seeking to destroy me; nevertheless, I cannot as yet sleep in peace without being troubled with fears.
6~I always fear this race of perverse men, who have their teeth and their tongue as sharp swords and darts, to wound me by their lies and calumnies. This is what, according to Bellarmine, is indicated by the Hebrew phrase.
7~Raise Thy power above the heavens, and make Thy glory shine upon the whole earth by delivering me from my enemies.
8~“<l>Incurvaverunt animam meam.</s>” They have made me bend under the weight of the evils with which they oppressed me.
10~I am ready to suffer all that Thou hast appointed for me; so that in all that may happen I shall not cease to praise Thee.
11~Arise my soul and glory in the Lord; and thou my harp and my lyre, hasten to praise the Lord; I wish to praise him without ceasing from the break of day.
13~I shall say, from the earth till the heavens, all is full of Thy mercy and Thy faithfulness.
14~See verse 7.
0~The prophet describes in this psalm the perverse conduct of the wicked, and shows the chastisement that God usually inflicts upon them.
2~You determine in your heart the wicked deeds, which afterwards your hands are ready unjustly to put in execution on earth.
6~He will render them powerless to injure others.
7~They shall be like a torrent that passes and is suddenly dried up; that is, their designs will quickly come to naught.
8~“<l>Supercecidit ignis, et non viderunt solem.</s>” The fire of divine vengeance will fall upon them, and they shall no more see the day.
9~St. Jerome translates: <l>Antequam crescant spinæ vestræ in rhamnum.</s> That is: Before you come to execute the evil that you design to do.
10~“<l>Vindictam.</s>” The justice of divine vengeance. “<l>Manus suas lavabit in sanguine peccatoris.</s>” That is, as is explained by St. Augustine, while seeing the blood, or the death of the sinner, he will preserve himself pure and innocent.
11~And then, seeing the fruit, or the profit that the just derive from the chastisement of the sinner, every one will recognize that there is in the world a God who knows how to judge over the earth, and to punish the wicked as they deserve.
0~David, seeing himself surrounded by the soldiers of Saul (1 Kings 19:11), invokes the Lord’s assistance and predicts the ruin of his enemies. This psalm applies in every point to Jesus Christ persecuted by the Jews.
2~“<l>De viris sanguinum.</s>” From these cruel men that thirst for my blood.
4~“<l>Neque iniquitas mea, neque peccatum meum.</s>” Thou knowest that there is in me no iniquity, nor any fault with which they can reproach me.
5~Thou seest the peril in which I am; arise to help me, O mighty God, O God of Israel.
6~“<l>Qui operantur iniquitatem.</s>” Who do not wish to cease to be unjust.
7~There are those that thus understand this verse: They will arrive late in the evening; but, like stray dogs, they will suffer great hunger, that is, they will have a great desire to be just in order to find peace; they will go round about the city of God, but they will not find mercy. Others explain it better, thus: They will go and return from morning till evening; they will even surround the city, seeking like dogs to satisfy their hunger, and to oppress the just; but they will be disappointed (see verse 16).
8~Their mouth will speak of nothing else than of laying snares and killing, saying at the same time: Who knows of it?
9~Thou wilt make them an object of ridicule, and wilt destroy all their wicked people.
11~God will make known to me the vengeance that he will take on my enemies. I pray Thee, O Lord! to punish them, but do not destroy them, so that my subjects, having always their chastisement before their eyes, may not forget Thy justice.
12~“<l>Depone eos.</s>” That is: Reduce them to such a state that they may not be able to raise their heads to injure me.
13~Let this be the punishment of their slanderous mouth and of their wicked discourse; may they be taken and confounded in their very pride.
16~In the mean time they continue from morning till night laying snares for the just, to devour them like hungry dogs, and they surround the city, in order that the prey may not be able to escape them (see verse 7).
17~They disperse in different places to devour the just; and if they do not succeed in satiating themselves with their blood, they do not cease at least to take away their good name.
20~Thou art my helper and defender in all my wants; and therefore I will always sing Thy praises, calling Thee my God and my Mercy.
0~David, already so often victorious over his enemies, implores God’s help against the Edomites (2 Kings 8:10); (1 Par. 18). This psalm applies very well to the Church, coming forth victorious amid so many persecutions.
1~O great God! it seems that Thou hast deprived us of Thy protection, since Thou hast let us see ourselves defeated; but, though Thou didst at first show Thyself angry with me, Thou hast in the end had compassion on me.
2~“<l>Sana contritiones ejus, quia commota est.</s>” It now remains for Thy mercy to repair the ruins made by this great shock.
3~Thou hast given proof of chastising us severely; Thou hast made us taste of the bitter wine of compunction (or, according to the Hebrew, of fear), and that in order to see us holily contrite.
4~“<l>Ut fugiant a facie arcus.</s>” In order that they may preserve themselves from the arrows of Thy wrath at the sight of the already bended bow.
5~Thou hast acted in this manner in order to save those that love Thee; hear me, then, and let Thy hand save me.
6~God has declared from his sanctuary that one day I shall have the joy of dividing at my will the country of Sichem or Samaria, and of measuring the plains of the Valley of Tents, beyond the Jordan, to distribute them at my pleasure.
7~I already see under my sway Galaad, Manasses, and Ephraim, which are the strength of my head. Under these names are meant the provinces occupied by the tribes of Israel, which David called the strength of his head, that is, of his crown.
8~“<l>Juda, rex meus.</s>” It is in the tribe of Juda that my throne is established, because God has willed that the kings should be chosen from this tribe. “<l>Moab, olla spei meæ.</s>” The province of Moab, which is abundant as a platter filled with meat, is my hope. That is: I hope to satiate my people with the spoils of the Moabites.
9~“<l>Alienigenæ.</s>” Foreigners.
10~Who will lead me into Edom, and make me master of that kingdom whose capital city is very strong?
11~Will it not be Thou, O Lord! who seemed at first to abandon us! And wilt Thou not Thyself go forth at the head of our troops to make us victorious?
12~“<l>Vana salus hominis.</s>” It is in vain that we can hope for our salvation in human intercourse; Thou must aid us Thyself.
13~In placing our hope in God we shall obtain the victory; he will destroy our enemies.

3~Thou hast led me by a sure way because Thou hast become for me as a strong tower in the face of my enemies.
5~In this place that Thou hast given me I shall always dwell securely, since there I shall be protected by Thy wings.
6~“<l>Annos ejus usque in diem generationis et generationis.</s>” Thou wilt even make his reign to endure from generation to generation.

8~“<l>Ut reddam vota mea de die in diem.</s>” In order to render Thee all the days of my life the thanks that I owe Thee.
0~David encourages himself and his followers to have confidence in God while persecuted and while oppressed by adversity.
3~“<l>In hominem.</s>” Upon himself. You are all killing me, at least by the desire that you have to take my life, and consider me as a leaning wall that is ready to fall.
4~“<l>Pretium meum.</s>” My honor, which is so precious to me. So this is understood by St. Ambrose and St. Augustine. “<l>Cucurri in siti.</s>” For this honor I so much toiled and sweated. Bossuet explains it thus: I fled like a thirsty stag pursued by the hunters. “<l>Benedicebant.</s>” They praised me.
5~“<l>Ab ipso patientia mea.</s>” Thou wilt receive from him patience to suffer all.
6~“<l>Non emigrabo.</s>” I will not quit my kingdom. I shall not be driven out. I shall not fall from the state in which I am.
9~“<l>In idipsum.</s>” That is, <l>Simul,</s> according to St. Jerome’s translation. They are deceiving one another.
10~“<l>Divitiæ si affluant.</s>” If riches come to you abundantly in the way of justice and honesty.
11~“<l>Potestas Dei est, et tibi, Domine, misericordia.</s>” God has power to punish the wicked, and mercy to console the just.

8~“<l>In velamento alarum tuarum.</s>” At seeing that Thou coverest me with Thy wings.
9~It is in vain that my enemies have sought to take my life; they shall lose their own instead, and shall be buried in the abyss of hell; there they shall be given into the hand of the avenging sword of God; they shall become the prey of foxes, that is, of devils who as foxes deceive men by their cunning.
10~“<l>Rex ... in eo.</s>” Some refer these words to David, and believe that there is question here of the oath of fidelity which had to be made to him when he came to the throne. But Rotigni and Lallemant say, with greater probability, that they refer to the Messias, the King of the world and true God; for it is one thing to swear allegiance to a king, and another to swear by the name of a king. This is the meaning of the words: <l>Jurant in eo.</s>
0~Pursued by calumny, David implores the help of God, and proclaims his hope of seeing this persecution turn to the ruin of his enemies and to the advantage of the just. In the mystical sense this psalm applies to the Passion of Jesus Christ.
6~“<l>Iniquitates.</s>” According to Bossuet: <l>Vias nocendi</s>—Their ways of injuring. The sense of the verse is: They have studied the ways of doing injury; but in this research they have found themselves foiled. This applies to the testimony brought forward against Jesus Christ.
7~Bossuet well explains this verse: When the wicked man cannot find fault with the just on the score of his actions, he tries to give a wrong interpretation to the secret thoughts of his heart; but God, who defends the innocent, will be exalted by punishing the wicked.
8~As the arrows discharged by children inflict only slight wounds, so the plots and calumnies of the wicked will have no effect; and therefore the arrows discharged by their tongues have become powerless to injure the objects of their calumny, and have fallen back upon themselves. This is according to the translation of St. Jerome: <l>Et corruent in semetipsos plagis suis.</s>
9~Those that have seen their chastisement were seized with surprise; and every one will henceforth fear to follow them.
10~In this all have recognized the hand of God, and have published it abroad.
0~The people ask with the greatest confidence that God may put an end to their captivity in Babylon. The Jews, slaves of the Chaldeans, represent here the Gentiles, the slaves of the devil.—This psalm well applies to the just, who sigh for the end of their exile here on earth.
1~Thou art worthy of being praised in Sion, and in Jerusalem shall worthy homage be paid to Thee.
2~If Thou wilt hear me, we shall come to Thee with all the people.
3~“<l>Verba.</s>” A Hebraism for <l>Opera.</s> Accordingly the verse is thus explained: The unjust deeds or plots of the enemy have prevailed against us; but Thou, O Lord! wilt have compassion on our sins, which have reduced us to slavery, and Thou wilt take us out of these great miseries.
4~Happy he whom Thou choosest for Thine own, and whom Thou hast taken under Thy protection: he shall dwell securely in Thy temple.
5~There in Thy house we shall be filled with good things; this Thy temple is all holy, and admirable for the love of justice which it inspires. It is said: “Of justice,” because the saints are admitted into this house while the wicked are excluded from it.
6~Hearken to us, O God, our Saviour, Thou who art the hope of all nations, even of those that dwell at the uttermost limits of the earth and in the most distant isles!
8~“<l>A signis tuis.</s>” When they behold the signs of Thy wrath. “<l>Exitus matutini et vespere delectabis.</s>” On the other hand, Thou shalt delight with Thy benefits the goings forth of the morning and of the evening; that is, of Thy servants who are in the East and in the West, where the sun rises and where it sets.
9~“<l>Inebriasti eam.</s>” That is: Thou hast poured upon it abundance of rain.
10~The river which Thou causest to run through the country is full of water, so as not to fail for Thy providing food for Thy people; since in this way art Thou wont to prepare the earth to bring forth its fruit.
11~Thou wilt satiate its furrows with water, and Thou wilt multiply its plants; the showers of rain shall be such that the earth will rejoice therein, and abound with fruit.
12~Throughout the circle of the year Thou wilt bless it with the signs of Thy goodness; and the fields will be filled by Thee with a rich harvest.
13~Even the deserts will become fertile and pleasant; and the hills will be girded with joy; that is, they shall be clothed with smiling verdure.
14~These fields and these hills will be covered with flocks; the valleys will abound with corn, and then all will resound with the voice of jubilee and hymns of praise to God.
0~This psalm is a song of thanksgiving addressed by the people to God for having delivered them from their enemies. It may be applied to the Gentiles delivered from the tyranny of the devil.
2~“<l>Mentientur tibi inimici tui.</s>” The very enemies, at the sight of Thy power, will come to submit themselves to Thy rule, but feignedly: <l>Mentientur.</s>
5~Reference is made to the passage of the Red Sea and the Jordan in the exodus from Egypt.

9~Thou hast tried us with tribulations, as silver is tried in the fire.
10~“<l>Imposuisti homines super capita nostra.</s>” Thou hast placed cruel men over us.
12,13~I will go into Thy temple to offer to Thee the sacrifices, and to render to Thee the thanksgivings that I owe Thee, according to the vows that I made to Thee.
14~“<l>Holocausta medullata.</s>” Victims, fat and full of marrow; that is, not only sacrifices of external works, but also of inward affections of the heart. “<l>Cum incenso arietum.</s>” Rams, fragrant with incense.
17~If I had regarded with attachment any iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have heard me.
19~May God be forever blessed, since he has not suffered me to forget to pray to him, because by my praying to him I have obtained his mercy so that he has not removed from me. St. Augustine has written this beautiful maxim: “<l>Cum videres non a te amotam deprecationem tuam. securus esto, quia non est a te amota misericordia ejus</s>—When thou seest that thy prayer is not removed from thee, be sure that neither is his mercy removed from thee.”
0~The psalmist addressed to God a fervent prayer, beseeching him to send the Messias, that he may thus make himself known and adored by all nations.
1~“<l>Illuminet vultum suum super nos.</s>” May God illuminate us by the splendors of his presence.
2~O Lord, let us know here on earth the way to please Thee, and cause that among all nations the Saviour, Thy Son, be known.
3~May all the nations thus enlightened confess that Thou art their God. May they praise and give Thee thanks.
5~May all the people praise Thee, O my God! and thank Thee for all Thy benefits; and especially because the earth, that is, the most pure womb of a Virgin, such as Mary, by the operation of the Holy Ghost, has brought forth the Fruit so greatly desired, the Saviour of the world. Wherefore, Jesus Christ was called by the angel the Blessed Fruit of Mary.
6~“<l>Deus, Deus noster, ... Deus.</s>” In this triple repetition of the name of God interpreters recognize a sufficiently clear indication of the Mystery of the Most Blessed Trinity. “<l>Metuant eum omnes fines terræ.</s>” May all men on earth, even to its farthest limits, fear and adore him.
0~In a figurative sense this psalm refers to Jesus Christ, who overcame death and ascended gloriously into heaven. It also foreshadows the sanctity of the Church and the protection that God, according to his promise, does not cease to give it a protection that should firmly establish it and make it glorious by so many victories. The prophet describes various prodigies of the Old Testament, figures of the prodigies that occurred in the New Testament. This psalm is, moreover, very obscure.
3~“<l>Delectentur in lætitia.</s>” Let them rejoice at their victory.
4~“<l>Qui ascendit super occasum.</s>” Who ascends above the darkness of the grave. “<l>Dominus nomen illi.</s>” For his name is that of the Lord: all things are under his dominion.
5~When he shall judge the world, sinners shall tremble with fear, while you shall stand rejoicing; for he is the Father of orphans, and the Judge who defends widows. This signifies that at the Last Judgment he will console all those that have been afflicted here on earth.
6~God sits in his sanctuary in heaven; and there in his house he makes his servants dwell; “<l>Unius moris,</s>” of one manner, that is, as one in unity of virtue and sentiments.
7~He sets free those that are held captive by their passions, and likewise those that have embittered him by their faults, and have dwelt in the sepulchre, the abode of death; that is, in his displeasure.
8,9~When Thou didst go forth in the sight of Thy people set free from Egypt, and didst go before them in the desert, in a cloud of light, the whole earth was moved, because the heavens showered down manna.
10~In the same way Thou dost wish to store up a great outpouring of grace for Thy inheritance, that is, for Thy new Church; so that, however infirm it may be, Thou knowest how to heal her and make her perfect.
11~There Thy flock shall abide, for which because of itself it is utterly poor, Thou hast in Thy goodness prepared abundant pastures.
12~The Lord will inspire words to those that will announce the new law, giving them great power to convert entire nations.
13~“<l>Rex virtutum dilecti dilecti.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Reges exercituum confæderabuntur</s>—The most powerful kings of the earth will become subjects of the Well-Beloved (according to the Hebrew <l>Dilecti dilecti</s>); that is, of the Redeemer, who will be greatly beloved by them. “<l>Et speciei domus dividere spolia.</s>” And he, in order to render his house, that is, his Church, beautiful, will give her the power to divide the spoils of those kings converted by means of the Evangelists: that is, of the apostles, who divided among themselves all the kingdoms of the world, to lead them to embrace the faith.
14~This verse is very obscure, says Bellarmine; hence it will be necessary to explain it in detail. “<l>Si dormiatis</s>” If you who preach the word of God sleep, that is, if you repose. “<l>Inter medios cleros.</s>” The word <l>Clerus</s> in Greek signifies lot, or inheritance; meaning: In the midst of the Church. But St. Jerome, St. Augustine, Theodoret, and others, understand by the word <l>Cleros,</s> the Old and New Testaments, and explain the first part of the words thus: If you repose in the midst of the two Testaments. “<l>Pennæ columbtæ deargentatæ.</s>” The Church, or the union of the faithful, will be like a dove with its wings silvered with the purity of wisdom. “<l>Et posteriora dorsi ejus in pallore auri.</s>” And with its back gilt by the fervor of charity, which makes it all beautiful.
15,16~“<l>Dum discernit cælestis reges.</s>” While the heavenly King, that is, Christ, will divide and send forth his preachers, raised to the dignity of kings by the spiritual power given them over souls. “<l>Super eam.</s>” Over the Church scattered throughout the kingdoms of the earth. “<l>Nive dealbabuntur.</s>” Then the nations, purified from the blackness of their sins, will be come whiter than snow. “<l>Mons Dei, mons pinguis, mons coagulatus.</s>” The mountain of God, the Church, is a fat, or rich mountain, a coagulated, that is, a very rich mountain; for the milk of divine grace, with which it abounds, does not run off, but remains there coagulated and firm. “<l>Ut quid suspicamini montes coagulatos?</s>” O men, why do you think that there is another Church as fat and as rich as this one?
18~The chariot of the Lord is borne by many thousands of angels in great jubilee; it was thus the Lord was borne upon these celestial spirits, when he descended upon the holy mountain of Sinai.
19~This passage is referred to by St. Paul (Eph. 4:8): <l>Ascendens in altum, captivam duxit captivitatem; dedit dona hominibus</s>—Ascending on high, He led captivity captive; He gave gifts to men. He adds: <l>Quod autem ascendit, quid est, nisi quia et descendit primum in inferiores partes terræ?</s>—Now, that he ascended, what is it, but because he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? The verse is, therefore, thus explained: Thou, O Saviour of the world! coming forth from the sepulchre, didst ascend to the highest heavens, and didst take with Thee those that were captives here below; and in heaven Thou didst receive the gifts from Thy Father, to dispense them to men.
20~For Thou hast bestowed Thy gifts on those who before did not believe that the Lord dwells in his holy mountain, that is, in his Church.
22~He is our God, whose property it is to save us; and it is his own gift to set us free from death. “<l>Exitus mortis.</s>” According to Bellarmine and Menochius: <l>Evasio mortis, ereptio et liberatio a morte</s>—Rescue and deliverance from death.
23~“<l>Verticem capilli.</s>” Denoting the top of the hair of the head; which means, that God will bring down the summit of their proud locks, or the crest of those that walk with pride in their sins, and do not walk in the law of God.
24~“<l>Ex Basan convertam.</s>” Mattei translates the Hebrew thus: <l>Ex Basan reducam.</s> That is: My people, I will deliver thee from the Basanites, or the people of Basan: and I will cast that people into the depths of the sea, as I did with Pharao.
26~Then did they see Thy glorious march, and Thy triumphs, O my King and my God! who art now in the holy place; that is, according to Bellarmine and Menochius, in heaven, or in the Church.
27~“<l>Principes.</s>” The heads of the people.
28~“<l>De fontibus Israel.</s>” According to the Chaldee version: <l>De semine Israel</s>—From the race of Israel. This is the reading adopted by St. Hilary, Theodoret, Euthemius, Vatable, and Tirinus, who cites these authors; and it is applicable to Jesus Christ: <l>Christo Domino, ortum habenti ex Israel</s>—To the Lord God, who has sprung from Israel.
29,30~“<l>Ibi.</s>” There in that triumph, described in verses 26, 27, and 28. “<l>Benjamin adolescentulus.</s>” The tribe of Benjamin, who was the last of the children of Jacob. “<l>In mentis excessu.</s>” In a transport of joy, as if in ecstacy. St. Hilary, St. Jerome, Theodoret, Bellarmine, and others, apply this passage to the apostles, who were almost all from one of the four tribes here named: St. Paul was of the tribe of Benjamin; St. James and St. John, and other relatives of our Lord, were of the tribe of Juda; and Galilee comprised especially the whole tribe of Zabulon and Nephthali.
32~“<l>A templo tuo.</s>” Mattei translates: <l>Post templum tuum;</s> and Bossuet: <l>Propter templum tuum.</s> The verse, then, is thus explained: After Thy temple has been built at Jerusalem, or, because of Thy temple that shall be built in Jerusalem, kings will offer Thee their gifts.
33~“<l>Feras arundinis.</s>” Bellarmine says that by this we are to understand the wild animals that hide among rushes. “<l>In vaccis.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In vitulis</s>—Calves. The verse therefore means: Frighten our enemies, who, as wild beasts, and like an assemblage or a troop of savage bulls, together with the calves of the people, that is, the dissolute young men, will seek to exclude from the temple those that have been proved as silver. Such is the explanation given by Bellarmine, Menochius, and Tirinus.
34~“<l>Præveniet manus ejus Deo.</s>” St. Jerome thus translates the Hebrew: <l>Festinet manus Deo;</s> and Father Mariana’s interpretation is: <l>Junget manus pacem petens.</s> The sense of the verse, then, is: Thou wilt scatter, O Lord! the nations that wish for war; then ambassadors from Egypt and Ethiopia will come running with joined hands to ask for peace.
36~“<l>Cælum cæli.</s>” A Hebraism, which signifies: The highest heaven. “<l>Ad Orientem.</s>” Towards the east; that is, towards the Mount of Olives situated at the east of Jerusalem. It is thus explained by Menochius and Tirinus, following St. Hilary and St. Jerome. The sense is, therefore: Give praise to God, who ascends from the Mount of Olives to the highest heaven.
37~“<l>Vocem virtutis.</s>” A voice of power and efficacy. “<l>Deo super Israel.</s>” To the God of Israel. “<l>In nubibus.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In cælis.</s> According to St. Augustine, this may be understood of the day of judgment when Jesus Christ will come <l>in nubibus coeli</s>—in the clouds of heaven; then, <l>dabit voci suæ vocem virtutis</s>—he will give unto his voice the voice of power; he will speak with so great power, that he will cause a great terror by the sentence that he will pronounce against the reprobate.
38~God will give to his people a virtue and a strength that will make them victorious over their enemies; let this great God be, therefore, ever blessed.
0~The holy Fathers and interpreters agree that this psalm refers to our Lord who was ill-treated by the Jews; it is also frequently quoted in the New Testament.
1~“<l>Aqua.</s>” The waters of affliction.
2~“<l>Non est substantia.</s>” St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>Non possum consistere.</s> That is, according to the explanation of Menochius: There is no consistence or solidity.
3~That is: I am as if engulfed in an abyss of bitterness that has overwhelmed me.
6~Behold Jesus Christ, who in dying satisfies for sins that are not his own.
7~Thou knowest the folly of which I am wrongly accused by men; and my sins, that is, those of men, which I have taken upon myself in order to atone for them. This agrees with what Isaias has said: <l>Iniquitates eorum ipse portabit</s>—He shall bear their iniquities (Is. 53:2).
8~“<l>Non erubescant.</s>” Let them not blush, or let them not be ashamed. “<l>In me.</s>” According to Bellarmine: <l>Propter me.</s> “<l>Qui expectant me.</s>” Those that wait for Thee, or those that trust in Thee. “<l>Virtutum.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Exercituum.</s>
9~“<l>Super me.</s>” According to Bellarmine: <l>Mei causa.</s>
11~“<l>Matris meæ.</s>” Of my mother, the Synagogue.
12~“<l>Comedit me.</s>” Has devoured me; or, according to the Chaldee, has consumed me: <l>Consumpsit me.</s>
13~This verse is very obscure. “<l>Operui in jejunio animam meam.</s>” According to the Hebrew: I overwhelmed myself with my tears in my fast.
15~“<l>Qui sedebant in porta.</s>” Those that were sitting at the gate; that is, the magistrates, who had their station in the public place of judgment. “<l>Qui bibebant vinum.</s>” The drunkards.
16~“<l>Tempus beneplaciti.</s>” St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>Tempus reconciliationis est.</s> For behold now the time of Thy good pleasure; that is, the time destined for the peace and reconciliation of men.
17~“<l>In veritate salutis tuæ.</s>” That is, according to the faithfulness of the promise which Thou hast made to save us.
19~“<l>Neque urgeat.</s>” According to Bellarmine and others: <l>Non claudat.</s> This is to be understood of the sepulchre from which Jesus Christ willed to rise, and to pass to life eternal.
23~“<l>Reverentiam.</s>” St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>Ignominiam.</s>
27~Their table, in retribution for their cruelty, shall become unto them a snare and an occasion of their ruin. Jesus Christ here predicts, under the form of imprecation, the evils that were to fall on the Jews. For this reason the text is given in the future tense; it is thus Menochius and the others understand it.
28~Their eyes will remain darkened, so that they will not see the precipice over which they shall fall; Thou wilt cause them to bend the back forever: that is, Thou wilt always keep them under the yoke of strange masters.
31~God has stricken his Son for the sins of the human race, as is written in Isaias (53:8): <l>Propter scelus populi mei percussi eum</s>—For the wickedness of my people have I struck Him. Moreover, the Jews have persecuted and added pain upon pain to his wounds.
32~On this text Bellarmine makes a wise remark: <l>Dicitur Deus facere, quando permittit fieri id quod sine ejus permissione fieret</s>—God is said to do, when he permits to be done, that which, without his permission, would not be done. The sense therefore is: Thou permittest these wicked men to add iniquity to iniquity, and that they should not enter into Thy justice, that is, that they should not be admitted to receive from Thee justification.
33~“<l>De libro viventium.</s>” That is, from the number of the elect.
34~“<l>Salus tua ... suscepit me.</s>” Thy salvation has taken me, or withdrawn me from these pains, by causing me to rise again. Or, as others explain the text, in a prophetic sense Thy power will save me by withdrawing me from these pains.
36~“<l>Cornua producentem et ungulas.</s>” That begins to have horns and hoofs.
37~The poor and afflicted will see it and will rejoice: O men, seek God, and thus your souls will live forever.
38~“<l>Vinctos suos non despexit.</s>” He does not despise his captives; that is, those that are loaded with the chains of their sins.
40~By Sion is understood the Church in general, and by the cities of Juda, the particular Churches. This is the explanation given by Bossuet and others.
41~In this happy land men redeemed shall dwell, and shall possess it as their own inheritance.
42~“<l>Qui diligunt nomen ejus, habitabunt in ea.</s>” It shall always be inhabited by those that love the glory of the Lord.
0~This psalm is almost the repetition of the last seven verses of Psalm 39. According to most of the Latin interpreters it is the prayer that Jesus Christ was to make on the cross. It may serve as a model to the faithful in their prayers, especially when they find themselves in grave danger.
2~“<l>Qui quærunt animam meam.</s>” Those that seek to take my life.
4~“<l>Euge, euge.</s>” Well done, well done, we have struck him down. Instead of this word, St. Jerome translates: <l>Vah! vah!</s> a word, as Bossuet remarks, not of praise, but of mockery, just as people sometimes cry out in derision: Hurrah! hurrah!
5~“<l>Qui diligunt salutare tuum.</s>” Those that love the salvation that Thou hast promised. Or, as Bossuet explains: Those that wish to be saved by Thee.
0~David prays to God to come to his aid in the persecution raised against him by his son Absalom. This psalm will serve for all the faithful when they are afflicted by temptations in order to trust in God and ask his help.
1~I have placed in Thee my hopes; I hope that I shall not be confounded forever; deliver me from the confusion in honor of Thy justice.
2~Give ear to my prayers, and save me from the dangers that threaten me.
6~“<l>Patientia.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Exspectatio.</s> Hence the verse may be explained with Bellarmine: Thou art my patience, that is, Thou art that divine Lord from whom I expect with patience my deliverance, since from my youth Thou hast been my only hope.
7~“<l>In te confirmatus sum.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Super te innixus sum;</s> or, as St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>A te sustentatus sum.</s> This means: In Thee I have been confirmed, that is, I have found my support and my prop.
8~My chant shall always be occupied with Thee, that is, I will always celebrate Thy goodness with praises; I am admired by many as a prodigy, through the benefits that Thou hast conferred upon me; and Thou art looked upon as a strong defence of those whom Thou protectest.
11~“<l>Qui custodiebant animam meam, consilium fecerunt in unum.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Qui observabant animam meam, inierunt consilium pariter.</s> Those that spied out my life, my way of living, have conspired against me. Others understand this of the guards whom David kept about his person, and explain it thus: Those that before guarded my life are now united to plot my ruin.
13~“<l>In auxilium meum respice.</s>” St. Jerome’s translation is better: <l>Ad auxilium meum festina.</s>
15~But I will always hope in Thee, my Lord, and I will add new praises to all those that I have given Thee. According to Bellarmine, Menochius, and Bossuet, something is here to be supplied.
16~“<l>Salutare tuum.</s>” The salvation that I have received from Thee.
17~“<l>Non cognovi litteraturam.</s>” I am little versed in human wisdom. Interpreters generally understand the word <l>Litteraturam</s> as if David meant to say: I have never made profession of that infamous cunning in which my enemy Achitophel abounds. “<l>Introibo in potentias Domini.</s>” I shall enter into the power of the Lord, that is, I shall set myself to praise the divine power. “<l>Memorabor justitiæ tuæ solius.</s>” I shall have nothing else before my eyes but the memory of Thy justice.
18~“<l>Et usque nunc pronuntiabo mirabilia tua.</s>” Wherefore I will never cease to celebrate the wonderful graces that Thou hast done unto me.
20~Till I succeed in proclaiming Thy arm, that is, Thy great power, to all the generations that shall come to inhabit this earth.
22~“<l>Et conversus, vivificasti me, et de abyssis terræ iterum reduxisti me.</s>” Then, appeased, Thou hast so to say restored to me life, and hast brought me back from the abyss of the earth, that is, from the depth of miseries.
23~“<l>Multiplicasti magnificentiam tuam.</s>” That is, Thou hast in many ways shown the greatness of Thy goodness towards me. “<l>Conversus.</s>” A Hebraism which signifies that the action is repeated.
24~“<l>In vasis psalmi.</s>” According to Menochius and Bossuet: <l>In musicis instrumentis,</s> “<l>Veritatem tuam.</s>” The faithfulness of Thy promises.
25~“<l>Anima mea, quam redemisti.</s>” My soul, which Thou hast redeemed, that is, hast set free from so many dangers. 
26~“<l>Meditabitur.</s>” That is: Shall praise while meditating.
0~David speaks here of his son Salomon, the presumptive heir of the kingdom of Israel, a figure of the spiritual kingdom of Jesus Christ. Thus speak commonly the holy Fathers and the commentators. Indeed, it seems to me that the whole or nearly the whole psalm should be applied to Jesus Christ; for certain expressions that are found in it, and especially verses 5, 11, 12, and 17, can only refer to Jesus Christ, to his coming among us, and to the vocation of the Gentiles; all of which mysteries David clearly saw by the prophetic light.
1~Give to the king the grace to judge justly, and grant to the son of David a righteous justice like Thine own.
3~“<l>Montes.</s>” This word is variously understood. Maldonatus understands it as if it were <l>Undique;</s> and meaning: May peace be enjoyed everywhere, even on the mountains. Emmanuel Sa writes: <l>Montes, id est, primores, sen præfecti</s>—the chief men or rulers. Malvenda: <l>Montes, id est, totum regnum montibus abundans</s>—the whole kingdom abounding with mountains. It is in this way Bossuet, with Bellarmine and Menochius, explains the verse: <l>Descendat de cælo pax et justitia, et super regnum Israeliticum requiescat</s>—May peace and justice descend from heaven and rest upon the kingdom of Israel. Lastly, Mariana, and with him Tirinus, says: <l>Montes, ubi scilicet solent esse latrones et feræ</s>—Mountains, that is, where robbers and wild beasts are wont to be. This last interpretation, as Lallemant thinks, seems to be the most probable. Hence the sense would be: May the mountains and the hills receive peace for the good of the people, that is: may even the people of the mountains, who are usually fierce and turbulent, taste the sweetness of peace and enjoy the fruits of the justice of the prince.
5~“<l>Ante lunam.</s>” Translation of St. Jerome: <l>Ultra lunam</s>—Beyond the moon. That is: His kingdom shall endure as long as the sun and the moon, and even beyond that.
6~“<l>Vellus.</s>” About this word there is a great diversity of opinion. Malvenda, Bellarmine, Menochius, Tirinus, etc., understand by it the fleece, or skin covered with wool, upon which Gedeon asked that all the dew that fell from heaven might be collected (Judges 6:37). Others, as Maldonatus, Mariana, Bossuet, Mattei, with Mark Marino, and Father Lallemant, are of opinion that the word Vellus here means something cut or shorn; hence Lallemant translates the passage thus: His coming to the throne will be like a rain that waters a meadow newly mown. But the first interpretation agrees better with that of St. Ambrose, Rupertus, and Procopius, who understand by the fleece the Mother of God, and by the dew the divine Word, who came down gently as the dew into the womb of the Virgin Mary, by the operation of the Holy Ghost. Moreover, the verse taken in this sense, has a better connection with the following: <l>Orietur in diebus ejus justitia et abundantia pacis</s>—In his days shall justice spring up, and abundance of peace. This is certainly to be understood of the coming of the Messias.
7~“<l>In diebus ejus</s>” Under his reign. “<l>Donec auferatur luna.</s>” This happy state will last till the end of the world.
8~“<l>A flumine.</s>” St. Augustine, Theodoret, etc., understand by the river, the Jordan, because it was there, at the baptism of Jesus Christ, the eternal Father’s voice was heard saying: <l>Hic est Filius meus dilectus, in quo mihi complacui</s>—This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased (Matt. 3:17).
9~“<l>Terram lingent.</s>” Shall lick the earth, that is, shall bow down to kiss the earth that is under his feet.
10~“<l>Reges Tharsis, et insulæ.</s>” The kings of India and the inhabitants of the isles.
11~These verses, from verse 5th, can apply only to Jesus Christ.
12~“<l>Pauperem.</s>” The weak, or the feeble.
13~“<l>Parcet.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Miserebitur</s>—He will have compassion.
14~“<l>Ex usuris.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Ab oppressione</s>—From oppression. “<l>Et iniquitate.</s>” And from iniquity, that is, from injustice.
15~“<l>Vivet.</s>” He shall live, that is, his reign shall be everlasting. “<l>Vivet et dabitur ei.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Vivet, et dabit ei.</s> Hence Maldonatus thus interprets this passage: The poor delivered by him shall live, and out of gratitude will give him gold of Arabia. “<l>Adorabunt de ipso.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Orabunt de eo.</s> These words are thus commented upon by Emmanuel Sa: <l>De eo, id est, pro eo.</s> The people will continually pray for him and for the prosperity of his kingdom.
16~“<l>Firmamentum.</s>” The Hebrew text, St. Jerome, Bellarmine, Mattei, Lallemant, and all the interpreters of the Compilation of Venice, attest that <l>Firmamentum</s> is put here for <l>Frumentum;</s> and this is the explanation that is given: There will be such an abundance of wheat upon earth, and even on the summits of the mountains, that its fruits will rise above Lebanon, that is, the ears will rise higher than the cedars of Lebanon; and the inhabitants of the city of God, which is the Church, shall flourish or spring up like the herb of the field.
17~“<l>Nomen ejus.</s>” The name of this new king. “<l>Ante solem.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Coram sole;</s> and as St. Jerome translates: <l>Ultra solem.</s> “<l>Permanet.</s>” According to St. Jerome, Menochius, Bossuet, etc., this verb is to be understood in the future.
0~This psalm describes the wretched happiness of the wicked and the blessed afflictions of the just, since the end of the one class will be very different from that of the other. We learn, hence, not to be astonished when we see the wicked prosper and the good afflicted.
1~“<l>Israel.</s>” To Israel, or towards the people of Israel. Father Lallemant has understood this name as if it were in the genitive; but in the Greek it is preceded by the article in the dative, and so in the Hebrew text, of which the sense is: <l>Certe bonus est Deus Israeli</s>—Truly, God is good to Israel. It is thus that Bossuet, with several others, explains it.
2~That is to say: My belief was almost shaken through the emotion that I felt.
3~“<l>Super iniquos.</s>” St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>Contra iniquos.</s> “<l>Pacem peccatorum videns.</s>” At seeing the peace in which sinners live on account of the prosperity which they enjoy, or to speak more correctly, which they flatter themselves that they enjoy.
4~“<l>Quia non est respectus morti eorum.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Quod non recogitaverint de morte sua</s>—Because they have not reflected on their death. “<l>Et firmamentum in plaga eorum.</s>” This passage is obscure, and is differently explained by interpreters. The word <l>Firmamentum</s> presents the greatest difficulty; But Gordona observes that if the particle <l>Non</s> be repeated, by understanding <l>Et</s> as <l>Nec,</s> the sense becomes easy. Thus: “<l>Nec est firmamentum in plaga eorum;</s>” <l>hoc est: Si quod illis accidit malum, cito transit, leve est, et sine firmamento</s>—Nor is there firmness in their wounds; that is, if any evil happens to them, it quickly passes, it is light and has no firmness. Hence the most natural explanation seems to be this: And in their wound, that is, when they feel themselves tormented by the fear of death, their affliction has no strength or firmness, and does not last long.
5~They are not in the travail of men, that is, they are exempt from poverty, from fatigues, and from other evils that afflict the generality of men; so that they are not scourged, that is, they do not suffer with other men.
7~“<l>Prodiit quasi ex adipe iniquitas eorum.</s>” Their iniquity has been produced by fatness, that is, by the abundance of their good things of the earth. Such is the explanation of Menochius. “<l>Transierunt in affectum cordis.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Transierunt cogitationes cordis;</s> that is: <l>Omnia contingunt illis supra spem</s>—They all have come to surpass their desires by obtaining more than they wished and hoped for.
8~They have meditated and uttered their wickedness, that is, they have employed their thoughts and their words to put in execution their wicked designs; and they have not been ashamed to publish their iniquity “<l>in excelso</s>” as from a high place, to make it known to the whole world.
9~They have opened their mouth ever against heaven; that is, according to Bellarmine, against God and his saints, and they have not abstained either from employing their tongue on earth against men. Malvenda’s comment is: <l>Quasi dicat: Nec Deo nec hominibus parcunt</s>—As though he would say: They spare neither God nor man.
10~Wherefore my people shall turn and see that for these impious men, notwithstanding their iniquity, these are days full of worldly satisfaction. Such is the explanation of Bellarmine and Lallemant.
11~And the men of my people say: How can it be that God, in whom is the science or knowledge of all that comes to pass on earth, should know this; and it may be added, should permit it?
12~“<l>Abundantes in sæculo.</s>” According to the Hebrew : <l>Pacifici sæculi.</s> Behold these sinners abound in riches in this world, so that they are esteemed as those who enjoy peace on earth.
13~“<l>Sine causa justificavi.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Frustra mundavi.</s> “<l>Inter innocentes.</s>” That is, with the innocent. 
14~“<l>Flagellatus.</s>” Scourged, chastised; that is, afflicted by the wicked.
15~St. Jerome’s translation: <l>Et dixi: Si narravero sic, ecce generationem filiorum tuorum reliqui.</s> The sense of the verse is: But afterwards I said: If I spoke thus, I should do wrong, and I should come to abandon the society of Thy children, that is, to disapprove of the religion of Thy faithful. 
16~I thought to be able to understand this conduct of Thy Providence; but I perceived that my labor was vain. “<l>Labor est ante me.</s>” That is, above my comprehension.
17~“<l>In sanctuarium.</s>” According to Bossuet: <l>In arcanum;</s> or according to Malvenda: <l>In sacratiora adyta.</s> The sense of the verse is: Until, by means of prayer, I enter into the sanctuary, that is, into the secret judgments of God; and then I came to understand the end of sinners, and what will be the miserable end of their happiness here on earth.
18~“<l>Posuisti eis.</s>” Menochius says: <l>Subintellige “Mala” ut habent aliqui textus græci</s>—Here we must supply <l>Mala,</s> as being understood, which some of the Greek texts have. The sense, then, is: Nevertheless, because of the deceits which they employ to exalt themselves, Thou hast prepared punishment for them; Thou hast caused their feet to fail them, and hast cast them down whilst they sought to raise themselves to power here on earth.
20~“<l>Velut somnium surgentium.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Quasi somnium evigilantis.</s> “<l>In civitate tua.</s>” According to Menochius: <l>In superna civitate.</s> That is: O Lord! at the end of all things, these miserable men shall be afflicted, as those are afflicted who, after dreaming that they have come to a great fortune, find themselves on awaking in the same poverty as before; and whereas Thy faithful servants shall be honored, in Thy city of heaven, they on the contrary shall be excluded from it, and the great figure that they have made in the world will be brought to nothing.
21~“<l>Inflammatum est cor meum, et renes mei commutati sunt.</s>” According to the Septuagint: <l>Lætatum est cor meum, et renes mei dilatati sunt;</s> and as Mattei says, the same version is found in St. Ambrose, as also in the ancient psalters. The passage is thus explained: Wherefore my heart was inflamed with joy and my reins were stirred with gladness, when I saw my fears vanish. “<l>Et ego ad nihilum redactus sum, et nescivi.</s>” And at the same time I was brought to naught, that is, I became aware of my own nothingness, of which I was before ignorant.
22~I confess that hitherto I have been like a beast of burden, not knowing the truth of my nothingness; and, therefore, henceforth, I desire to be always united to Thee, who art my only good.
23~Thou hast held my right hand; that is, Thou hast kept me up, so that I might not be lost; Thou hast led me to live according to Thy will, and Thou hast covered me with glory.
25~My flesh and my heart have failed, that is, can no longer resist the attraction of Thy love, which draws me to Thee; Thou art the God of my heart; it is for Thee alone to possess it eternally; Thou alone must be my portion and all my good.
26~Those that withdraw from Thee will in the end perish; for Thou justly sendest to perdition those that love other objects than Thee. It is thus that Menochius, Sa, Mariana, and Tirinus understand the expression: “<l>Qui fornicantur abs te.</s>”
27~My only good is to adhere and entirely unite myself to God, and to place in him all my hopes.
28~And thus I hope, one day, to publish Thy glories in Jerusalem, which is called the daughter of Jerusalem.
0~The Jewish people, submissive and humbled, weep over their captivity and the destruction of the temple; then, imploring Heaven to favor their religion and their kingdom, the children of Israel called to mind the many prodigies worked by God and the numerous benefits received from his bounty. Bellarmine and other interpreters think that there is question here of the persecution of Antiochus at the time of the Machabees. This psalm may be used for asking God’s help in the persecutions that the Church suffers at the hands of her enemies.
2~“<l>Ab initio.</s>” Menochius understands by this the time when the people of Israel had no other king than God: <l>Quæ nullum habuit regem ante te.</s>
3~“<l>Virgam.</s>” According to St. Augustine, Theodoret, Symmachus, Euthymius, Bellarmine, and Mattei: <l>Sceptrum</s> or <l>Regnum.</s> Explanation: Thou didst redeem the sceptre of Thy inheritance, that is, the kingdom of the Promised Land, by driving out the enemies that occupied it; there is Mount Sion, where Thou hast vouchsafed to dwell for our good.
4~Raise the hands of Thy dread power, to strike down entirely their arrogance; Thou knowest how many evils this hostile people has wrought in the holy place; that is, in the holy city, or in the holy Temple.
5~Those that hated Thee have gloried in their insults committed in the Temple when solemnities were offered to Thy name. “<l>In medio solemnitatis tuæ.</s>” According to Menochius: <l>Dum sacra solemnia peragerentur</s>—Whilst the sacred solemnities were going on.
6~“<l>Posuerunt signa sua, signa.</s>” They have placed their signs, that is, their banners, on the summit of the Temple. “<l>Et non cognoverunt.</s>” According to St. Jerome, Theodoret, Tirinus, etc.: <l>Neque curarunt quantus honor deberetur Templo tuo</s>—And had no thought of how great honor was done to Thy Temple. “<l>Sicut in exitu.</s>” According to Mattei: As a common thoroughfare; or, according to Lallemant: As the vilest place to be found in the whole city.
12~Why holdest Thou Thy hand afar off, and almost wholly idle, in Thy bounteous bosom, without pouring upon us Thy accustomed graces?
13~“<l>In medio terræ.</s>” Mazzocchi says that this is a Hebraism, and that it means the same as <l>In terra.</s>
14~Here the psalmist begins to relate the wonders wrought in behalf of his people: By Thy virtue, or by Thy power, Thou didst make the sea firm and stable, after having divided it for the passage of the Hebrews; and Thou didst lay low, submerged in those waters, the heads of the dragons, that is, the chiefs of the Egyptians; as is explained by Euthymius and other interpreters.
15~Thou didst break the pride of the dragon; that is, of this hostile people who, being sunk, was made by Thee the prey of the Ethiopians, who reaped the spoils. According to Malvenda and Menochius, by the Ethiopians are meant properly the Arabians who inhabit, the shores of the Red Sea, and are called Ethiopians in Scripture.
16~“<l>Dirupisti fontes et torrentes.</s>” According to Bellarmine: <l>Dirupta petra, fecisti scaturire fontes et torrentes</s>—When Thy people passed through the desert, Thou, from a dry rock broken by Moses, didst cause to spring forth fountains and torrents of water. “<l>Siccasti fluvios Ethan.</s>” Thou didst dry up the river Ethan. Bellarmine, Menochius, Lallemant, and Panigarola understand here the river Jordan; but Mattei says that it is in vain to seek what is this river <l>Ethan,</s> and that this word is rather an adjective, which means <si>Rapid.</s> In fact, St. Jerome translates: <l>Flumina fortia</s>—Strong rivers. Bellarmine, Menochius, and Tirinus also give this meaning. Rotigni and Mattei say, however, with Bellarmine: <l>Interpretes cœteri relinquere maluerunt ipsam vocem hebraicam non interpretatam</s>—that is, they prefer to leave the word untranslated.
17~“<l>Tuus est dies, et tua est nox.</s>” That is: Thou hast made both the day and the night.
18~“<l>Æstatem et ver.</s>” By the summer and the spring is meant the whole year; because anciently, say the learned, the year was divided only in two parts; and in fact, according to the Hebrew, instead of “<l>Ver</s>” it is <l>Hyemem</s>—Winter.
19~“<l>Hujus.</s>” Some refer this pronoun to what has gone before as if the psalmist said: O Lord! remember this, namely, these works of Thine. But others more commonly, with Bellarmine, refer it to that which follows, in this sense: Have before Thy eyes what I am about to say to Thee. “<l>Incitavit.</s>” Has provoked or blasphemed.
20~“<l>Ne tradas bestiis animas confitentes tibi.</s>” Abandon not to the power of these wild beasts, as are these our enemies, the lives of those that are faithful to Thee.
21~“<l>Testamentum tuum.</s>” That is, the covenant that Thou hast made with our fathers. “<l>Qui obscurati sunt terræ.</s>” According to Bellarmine: <l>Qui obscurati sunt in terra, viles et barbari homines.</s> “<l>Iniquitatem.</s>” that is, <l>Inique.</s> Hence this interpretation: Consider how these vile men have unjustly possessed themselves of our houses and of all our property. This second part of the verse is very obscure, as Mattei and others remark.
22~Permit not, O Lord! that Thy people, after having been so humiliated, should be brought to confusion: they are poor, are needy; but raised up by Thee, they will know how to praise Thy name and to give Thee thanks.
23~“<l>Causam tuam.</s>” This cause which is not only ours, but in truth Thy own.
24~“<l>Voces.</s>” The blasphemies.
0~In this psalm a prayer is offered to God to hasten to the help of the good and the punishment of the wicked. Yet it is in some way a dialogue between God and his people who are in slavery. May the just here learn to reanimate their courage, and the wicked to tremble.
2~“<l>Cum accepero tempus.</s>” That is: When the fitting time has come. (Here it is God that speaks). “<l>Justitias judicabo.</s>” <l>Quod justum est, decernam</s>—What is just I will determine. This is the explanation of Tirinus with St. Jerome and Theodoret.
3~“<l>Liquefacta est.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Dissolvetur.</s> Then in the time of my vengeance the earth shall be dissolved, and all its inhabitants with it through the terror that they shall feel; but I will again set up its columns, that is, its foundations, its solidity. This verse is obscure, and different interpretations are given of it.
4~(Some think that God continues to speak; but Lallemant with more probability says that it is the psalmist who speaks here). “<l>Cornu.</s>” According to Bellarmine: <l>Superbiam</s>—Pride.
5~“<l>Cornu vestrum.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Gloriam vestram</s>—Do not take pride in your glory.
6~“<l>Neque ab Oriente.</s>” ... According to Bossuet and Mattei here should be supplied: <l>Veniet vobis auxilium.</s> The sense is: At the time of punishment there shall come to you no help, neither from the East nor from the West. ... Others explain thus: In vain will you hope to fly for refuge in the East. ... But the former explanation is more common, and pleases me better. “<l>Quoniam Deus judex est.</s>” God himself being judge, no one can hinder the execution of his judgments.
7~“<l>Vini meri plenus misto.</s>” Full of pure wine, that is, of justice, and also, at the same time, of mixture, that is, of pity, so as to temper justice with mercy, as says St. Jerome (In Malach, iii.)
8~“<l>Inclinavit.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Effudit, propinavit.</s> From this cup thus tempered the Lord pours in turn one and the other on men, giving them at one time graces, at another punishments. “<l>Verumtamen fax ejus non est exinanita; bibent omnes peccatores terræ.</s>” But let sinners know that the dregs, that is, the bitterest part of this cup, is not entirely emptied; the wicked shall all drink of it. Bellarmine remarks that for sinners the greater part of their pains, besides those of this life, is reserved for them on the Day of Judgment.
10~I will ever strive to repress and break down the pride of sinners; and will, on the other hand, publish the glory of the just, who shall be exalted.
0~This psalm is a canticle of praise and thanksgiving which the Jews address to God for having aided them to be victorious over their enemies. Some Fathers believe that it was composed after the victory gained over the Assyrians and the defeat of the army of Sennacherib (4 Kings 19:35), the title of it being according to the Vulgate: <l>Canticum ad Assyrios.</s> But Grotius and Xavier Mattei think that David composed it after his victory over the Ammonites (2 Kings 10), and that afterward Ezechias recited it after the defeat of the Assyrians. It may be used by Christians to thank God for having delivered them from their enemies.
2~“<l>In pace.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In Salem.</s> The word <l>Salem</s> signifies <si>Peace;</s> but here it denotes the city of Jerusalem. Lallemant with others has, therefore, well translated the verse: He has chosen his dwelling-place in Jerusalem, and his habitation on the mountain of Sion.
3~He has broken: “the powers of the bows,” that is, the bows of the hostile powers, and the shields, and the swords, and all the forces of their enemies who were making war.
4~“<l>A montibus æternis.</s>” Nearly all the modern interpreters read according to the Hebrew: <l>A montibus prædæ</s> or <l>rapinæ;</s> and this agrees with the translation of St. Jerome: <l>A montibus captivitatis.</s> Whence it is thus explained: Thou, O Lord! hast caused a marvellous light to shine forth from the mountains of plunder, that is, where our army seized on the spoils of the enemy. “<l>Turbati sunt omnes insipientes corde.</s>” St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>Spoliati sunt superbi corde.</s> The proud remained conquered and despoiled of everything.
5~These men, so proud of their power and of their riches, stricken by the sleep of death, have no longer found anything in their hands. This is the translation of Lallemant; but according to this sense I should prefer to render the verse thus: To the rich of the earth, at the hour of death, all the riches that they have possessed will seem like a dream, since then they will find nothing any more in their hands. Others, however, following the Hebrew text, which instead of “<l>Divitiarum</s>” has <l>Fortitudinis,</s> explain the passage in a sense quite different, thus: They slept and on awaking they found no strength in their hands, that is, they saw that their strength was gone. Bossuet, quoting the translation of St. Jerome, in which we read the word <l>Exercitus</s> for <l>Fortitudinis</s> or <l>Divitiarum,</s> gives still another interpretation: <l>Parte exercitus cæsa, et somnum mortis dormiente, reliqui, conterriti, nec pugnare potuerunt.</s> A part of the army being killed, the rest, seized with terror, were unable to fight anymore. I see no reason for departing from the first sense. The word <l>Fortitudinis,</s> given in the Hebrew, makes nothing against it; for men of the world regard riches as their strength. This fully accords with the Hebrew text.
6~By reason of Thy wrath, or of Thy chastisement, even those were smitten with death that thought themselves the strongest, because they were mounted on horseback.
7~“<l>Ex tunc ira tua.</s>” According to Estius and others: <l>Cum ira tua fuerit commota</s>—When Thy anger is aroused.
8~“<l>Judicium.</s>” The sentence of punishment launched against the enemy: “<l>Terra tremuit, et quievit.</s>” The earth quaked with terror, and then at once there was calm. But according to the Hebrew, instead of “<l>quievit</s>” it is “<l>siluit.</s>” That is: The inhabitants of the earth trembled and kept silence through terror.
9~“<l>Mansuetos.</s>” All those that are meek, that is, his humble servants.
10~This verse is obscure. Lallemant explains it thus: Hence Thy servants who have received mercies from Thee will never think of them without thanking and praising Thee for them; and the memory thereof will cause them to celebrate feasts in Thy honor. But others more commonly, as Maldonatus, Malvenda, Grotius, Mariana, Rotigni, Mattei, etc., supported by the Hebrew text, which instead of the word “<l>Cogitatio</s>” gives <l>Ira,</s> explain it thus: For the fury of hostile man will cause us to praise Thy goodness and power on seeing his defeat; and the remains of the enemy’s fury will serve Thee for a feast, since it will move us to celebrate a festival in Thy honor, in order to praise Thee and return Thee thanks.
12~“<l>Qui aufert spiritum principum.</s>” Who takes away life from princes; or, following this translation from the Hebrew: <l>Qui coercet spiritum principum</s>—Who subdues the pride of princes.
0~According to a large number of interpreters, we have here the prayer that the captive people at Babylon offered up to God. However this may be, this psalm finds a natural place on the lips of those that are in affliction, who aspire, as St. Augustine says, to leaving the exile of this earth in order to enter the heavenly country.
1~“<l>Intendit mihi.</s>” The literal translation of the Hebrew is: <l>Aures mihi præbuit;</s> or according to St. Jerome: <l>Exaudivit me.</s>
3~The following is the explanation of Lallemant: My soul plunged in sorrow, refused all consolation: I remembered God, and this memory filled me with joy; but the thought of my evils made me fall again into despondency. Other interpreters, as Malvenda, Maldonatus, Rotigni, and Mattei, follow the Hebrew text, which instead of the word “<l>Delectatus</s>” gives <l>Conturbatus.</s> St. Jerome understands it in the same sense; we read in his commentary: <l>Memor fui Dei, et conturbabar. Qui olim, quamvis afflictus, audito Dei nomine, respirabam, nunc, minis ejus territus, divini nominis recordatione conturbor.</s> I remembered God, and was troubled. I who formerly, however much afflicted when I heard the name of God, would again breathe freely (or revive), now, terrified by his threats, am troubled at the recollection of the divine name. And so, following this interpretation of St. Jerome, which seems to be the one most received, the passage is explained thus: I remembered God, and instead of being consoled by his remembrance, I was thereby still more troubled. “<l>Exercitatus sum.</s>” St. Jerome translates thus: <l>Loquebar in memetipso.</s> The sense then of this latter part of the verse is: And speaking, complaining, in myself, I remained anxious and restless through sadness, so that my spirit fainted within me.
4~My eyes looked forward to the dawn, that is, I passed the whole night without being able to sleep because of the trouble that I suffered, and without saying a word.
5~“<l>Annos æternos.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Annos sæculorum</s>—I thought of the ancient days, and I had in my mind the ages of the past. David recalled to his memory, in order to comfort himself, the graces and the favors that he had formerly received from God, and the benefits conferred upon his people.
6~“<l>Et meditatus sum.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Recordabar cantici mei;</s> or, following the translation of St. Jerome: <l>Psalmorum meorum.</s> At night I meditated in my heart the time when I sang canticles; and thus I exercised myself, and searched out my spirit, that is, I examined my conscience. “<l>Scopebam.</s>” St. Augustine in his day read: <l>Perscrutabar</s>—I searched through.
7~“<l>Non apponet ut complacitior sit adhuc?</s>” Will he not show himself more appeased and propitious? Such is the sense that St. Jerome gives according to the Hebrew: <l>Non repropitiabitur ultra?</s> And thus also Bellarmine, Bossuet, etc., understand it.
10~“<l>Hæc mutatio.</s>” Some understand this change in respect to God, following the translation of St. Jerome, who renders the verse thus: <l>Et dixi: Imbecillitas mea est hæc: commutatio dexteræ Excelsi.</s> That is: I said that my weakness, or my wickedness, is the cause of the change of the right hand of the Most High, who from being clement has changed so as to become severe. But others, as Lallemant, with St. Augustine, understand the change to be wrought in the psalmist who speaks: “<l>Et dixi: Nunc cœpi ...</s>”; which is explained thus: I said that now I begin to breathe again by means of hope; or, according to others, I have now determined to change my life, and this change is the work of the right hand of the Most High, that is, of divine grace, <l>dispellentis,</s> writes St. Augustine, <l>priorem nebulam et caliginem:</s> of grace, which delivering me from the cloud of darkness in which I was before, draws me to himself with a new light. St. Antony, the abbot, enjoined, upon his disciples to repeat every morning, when renewing the good intention of giving themselves entirely to God, these words: <l>Et dixi: Nunc cœpi.</s>
11~“<l>Quia.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Certe, quin etiam.</s> And assuredly, I shall continue to remember the wonderful things which Thou, O my God, hast wrought since the beginning of the world.
12~“<l>In adinventionibus tuis exercebor.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Adinventiones tuas loquar.</s> And Bossuet explains the passage thus: <l>Sapientiæ tuæ arcana, et ad salutem nostram excogitata consilia</s>—I shall exercise myself in praising the loving inventions of Thy wisdom with a view to our salvation.
13~“<l>In sancto via tua.</s>” Bossuet: <l>Viæ tuæ sanctæ.</s> That is, following the explanation of Bossuet: Thy designs and Thy works are always in holiness.
14~“<l>Redemisti.</s>” Thou hast redeemed or delivered Thy people from the hands of their enemies.
15~The waters saw Thee, O God Almighty! they were stricken with terror, and out of reverence and awe they drew back to their abysses, that is, to their lowest depths. Bellarmine explains this of the waters of the Red Sea, which at the command of God divided to give a passage for the Hebrews.
16~Then there was heard a great sound, that is, the great roaring of the waves of the sea, when they rushed on the Egyptians to overwhelm them; the clouds also gave forth their voice, raining with fury on the enemies.
17~Lallemant translates: Thy lightnings flashed on all sides, and Thy thunderbolts broke up the wheels of the enemy’s chariots. But other interpreters render the sense better thus: The hailstones struck like arrows, and the voice of Thy thunder, that is, the thunder made a noise like that of a wheel creaking by reason of its rapid motion. “<l>In rota.</s>” Bossuet says: <l>Instar rotæ rapide discurrentis.</s> Thus also is it explained by Maldonatus and Mariana.
19~“<l>Vestigia tua non cognoscentur.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Vestigia tua non sunt agnita.</s> Thy traces, that is, those of Thy people who passed over dry shod, were not known by the enemy, who remained submerged.
0~This psalm recalls briefly all that the Lord has done for his people from the time of Moses till the days of David. The psalmist, while exalting the munificence of God, expresses his detestation of the ingratitude of the Hebrews.
1~“<l>Legem meam.</s>” My precepts, or my teaching.
2~“<l>In parabolis.</s>” The learned Mazzochi (Spicil. Bibl. in Num. xxiii. 7) says, that in Scripture the word <l>Parabola</s> is used for every kind of poetical composition; whence it is explained: I will open my mouth to sing in verse. “<l>Loquar propositiones ab initio.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Loquar ænigmata antiqua</s>—I will speak ancient enigmas. This agrees with the Gospel of St. Matthew (13:35), in which we read: <l>Eructabo abscondita a constitutione mundi</s>—I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world: I will declare unto you the mysteries of ancient deeds, come to pass since the beginning of the world.
3~“<l>Quanta audivimus.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Qua audivimus.</s>
6~“<l>Suscitavit.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Statuit</s>—He established. “<l>In Jacob, ... In Israel.</s>” Among the posterity of Jacob.
7~“<l>Quanta.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Quæ</s>—Which.
10~“<l>Prava et exasperans.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Amara et rebellis;</s> or, following the translation of St. Jerome: <l>Declinans et provocans</s>—Inconstant and irritating.
11~“<l>Non est creditus cum Deo.</s>” St. Jerome has: <l>Non credidit Deo</s>—Believe not God.
12~“<l>Filii Ephrem.</s>” The tribe of Ephraim.
15~“<l>Taneos.</s>” Tanis, the capital city of Lower Egypt (Menochius).
16~“<l>Quasi in utre.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Quasi cumulum;</s> or, according to St. Jerome: <l>Quasi acervum</s>—Piled up high in a heap.
17~“<l>Diei, ... In illuminatione.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Pre diem ... In lumine.</s> The Lord went before them to show the way by day in a pillar of cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire (Exod. 13:21).
18~“<l>Adaquavit.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Potum dedit.</s> “<l>Velut in abysso multa.</s>” Menochius explains: <l>Ac si essent ad ripam profundissimi fluminis</s>—As though they were on the bank of a deep river.
20~“<l>Apposuerunt adhuc peccare.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Iterum peccaverunt;</s> or, according to the translation of St. Jerome: <l>Addiderunt ultra peccare.</s> “<l>In inaquosa.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>In arido deserto.</s>
21~In the psalm of the <l>invitatorium,</s> verse 4, is explained what we read here. The Hebrews in asking of God for bread and flesh, in the midst of the desert (Exod. 16:3; Num. 11:4), wished to tempt him in order to see by this experiment whether he were really able to provide them with such food in a place deprived of everything.
22~“<l>Parare mensam.</s>” Prepare for us a table such as we desire.
25~“<l>Distulit.</s>” Mattei interprets: <l>Distulit implere</s>—He delayed to fulfil his promises; but it appears to me better to say: He suspended the course of his benefits to those ungrateful men. “<l>Jacob ... Israel.</s>” The posterity of Jacob.
27~“<l>Januas cæli aperuit.</s>” This is said to show the abundance of manna that came down from heaven.
28~“<l>Manna.</s>” Bellarmine says that this name comes from the wonder excited in the people when they saw the earth covered with this extraordinary food, spread over the ground like hoar-frost, and said to one another: <l>Man Hu?</s> which signifies: <l>Quid est hoc</s>—What is this? (Exod. 16:15). The same author adds that manna was the seed of the coriander. “<l>Panem cæli.</s>” The manna was thus called, because it came from heaven or from the atmosphere.
29~“<l>Panem angelorum.</s>” It was thus called, because it was formed by the operation of the angels.
30~According to the interpretation of Lallemant, the Lord caused the Auster or east wind to cease, and made the Africus or south wind blow in its place. But Bellarmine remarks that the east wind, Auster (or Eurus), denoted in the Hebrew text is not opposed to the Africus, but is rather next to it and united with it. Hence Theodoret, Euthymius, and others, do not give to the word <l>Transtulit</s> the sense of <l>Cessare fecit</s>—Made to cease; but that of <l>Flare jussit</s>—Commanded to blow; as if it were said, following the explanation of St. Augustine: <l>Transtulit de cælesti thesauro, et emisit in terram</s>—So that God ordained that these two winds together should bring the quails in the desert.
34~“<l>Ascendit.</s>” The same expression as in verse 25. When the fire of anger is great, its flame rises on high.
35~“<l>Pingues eorum.</s>” Bellarmine understands by this: The most voluptuous; Lallemant: The strongest. “<l>Electos Israel impedivit.</s>” This means, according to Lallemant, that he struck with death the choice or the pick of their youth; and, according to Bellarmine, that the strongest among them were by God prevented from escaping death.
36~“<l>Non crediderunt in mirabilibus ejus.</s>” Such wonders could not induce them to fear the Lord and trust in him.
37~They consumed uselessly their days in the desert; and their years were shortened.
40~They promised to love him; but this promise was only in their mouth, on their tongue, and they thus lied to God.
42~“<l>Non disperdet eos.</s>” God, who is always compassionate towards others, notwithstanding their sins, would not utterly destroy all his people as they deserved.
44~God remembers, that is, he considers that these sinners are men of flesh, weak, and filled with misery, whose life is as a passing wind that lasts but a short time, which comes and goes but does not return. Thus the young man passes on to old age, but does not return to youth.
47~“<l>De manu tribulantis.</s>” From the hand of their enemy, Pharao, who oppressed them.
48~“<l>Taneos.</s>” (See verse 15.)
49~“<l>In sanguinem.</s>” Into the color of blood. “<l>Flumina.</s>” Bellarmine says that by these rivers are to be understood the different branches of the Nile which run through Egypt. “<l>Imbres.</s>” This properly is not rain, of which there is hardly any in that country, but every kind of water, especially the overflowing of the Nile (Exod. 7:20).
50~“<l>Cœnomyiam</s>” (Exod. 8:24). It is a question whether this should be written <l>Cœnomyia,</s> the common fly, or <l>Cynomyia,</s> the dog-fly. The Vulgate has the first, but the Greek more commonly prefers the second; St. Jerome varies.
51~“<l>Ærugini.</s>” To the rust. Caterpillars and locusts, according to St. Jerome’s explanation, devour the herbs like rust or mildew (Exod. 10:13).
52~“<l>Moros.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Sycomoros;</s> and St. Gregory makes this remark: <l>Sycomorus, quippe ficus fatua dicitur.</s> The word <si>Sycamore,</s> etymologically, meaning a foolish fig (Mor. l. 27, c. 27). “<l>In pruina.</s>” Mattei says that the Hebrew word signifies here great hail-stones.
53~“<l>Igni.</s>” By this fire, Mattei understands with probability, frost; which also burns the fields. He does this to avoid introducing another plague of Egypt, that of fire, of which Moses makes no mention.
56~“<l>Primitias omnis laboris eorum.</s>” Men labor hard to bring up their first-born, and for this reason they are called the first-fruits of their labors. “<l>In tabernaculum Cham.</s>” It was the descendants of Cham, son of Noe, who peopled Egypt after the deluge.
57~It is thus, says the psalmist, that God delivered his people from the slavery of Egypt.
58~He led the Israelites full of confidence and without fear, because their enemies were now sunk in the Red Sea; and thus their slavery was at an end.
59~“<l>In montem sanctificationis suæ.</s>” This, as Bellarmine explains, signifies the Promised Land; a mountain, that is, a mountainous land, which God had chosen for himself to be there honored by his people; a mountain, or land, which he had acquired by his own right hand; having wrought so many miracles to help the Israelites in conquering and driving out the idolaters who inhabited it.
60~“<l>Gentes.</s>” The hostile nations, or the Chanaanites, who inhabited the land. “<l>In funicula distributionis.</s>” The lands were measured with cords, according to the custom of those times, to be then distributed by lots to the families of the Israelites.
66~“<l>Silo.</s>” A town of the tribe of Ephraim, where abode for some time the Ark of the Covenant, which God caused to be made in the desert, and where the Lord in some sense dwelt amongst men; since it was thence he gave to them his answers.
67~“<l>Virtutem eorum et pulchritudinem eorum.</s>” The strength and the glory of the people of Israel was the holy Ark, as Menochius, Lallemant, and Bossuet, with St. Augustine, explain: God permitted that it should become the spoil of the enemy, namely, of the Philistines (1 Kings 4:11).
68~He suffered, moreover, that his people should be encompassed on all sides by the swords of their enemies; and thus he had to despise that people whom he had chosen as his heritage; that is, to be to him a peculiar and special people.
69~“<l>Ignis.</s>” The fire of war, or rather of the divine wrath “<l>Lamentatæ;</s>” Some explain this word in an active sense; but Bellarmine, Lallemant, and Mattei think with more reason that it should be taken in the passive sense; thus the meaning is: After the death of the young men, the young maidens whom they were to marry had no one to lament their sad lot; because in the general massacre every one had to bewail the losses in his own family, rather than those of others; and this explanation agrees well with the Hebrew text, which St. Jerome renders thus: <l>Virgines ejus (populi) nemo luxit</s>—No one mourned the virgins of the people.
70~“<l>Sacerdotes eorum.</s>” Ophni and Phinees, the sons of Heli (1 Kings 4:11). “<l>Non plorabantur.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Non sunt fletæ.</s> None consoled nor even pitied them, because all were occupied with weeping the death of their own relatives.
71~But at last the Lord awoke, as wakes up a strong warrior who, heavy with wine, has fallen into a deep sleep. This is the interpretation given by Bellarmine, Menochius, Gordona, and Lallemant; they say that God when he does not punish the wicked seems to sleep a deep sleep. But Mattei justly remarks that the parallel of a drunken man waking up from sleep is ill becoming to God; and he adds that the verse contains not one but two similes; the first is that of the awaking “<l>Excitatus est tamquam dormiens;</s>” the second is that of the return that God makes against his enemies, like a mighty warrior, strengthened and whetted for fight by the wine that he has taken: <l>Tamquam potens miles exhilaratus a vino;</s> this agrees with the Hebrew text, which is rendered by <l>Ovans</s> or <l>Exhilaratus</s>—Cheered or Refreshed, instead of “<l>Crapulatus.</s>”
72~“<l>Inimicos suos.</s>” The Philistines. “<l>In posteriora.</s>” That is: <l>In secretiori parte natium</s> (1 Kings 5:6). God punished their pride by sores so disgraceful, that they were a perpetual cause of shame to them.
73~“<l>Tabernaculum Joseph.</s>” That is, the Tabernacle containing the Ark of the Covenant, which was at Silo, a city of the tribe of Ephraim, son of Joseph.
74~“<l>Elegit tribum Juda, montem Sion, quem dilexit.</s>” He chose the tribe of Juda, to establish his Tabernacle, Mount Sion, preferring it to all other places in Juda.
75~And on this Mount Sion, that is, at Jerusalem, a land that he established to last forever, he built his sanctuary, firm and strong as the horn of the unicorn. Bellarmine says that Jerusalem, which was afterwards destroyed, is here a figure of the Church, which is to endure till the end of the world. Mattei adds that Mount Sion was compared to the unicorn because upon it was the Temple, which was the only temple of Judea.
77~God took David from the humble condition of a shepherd, to place in his hand the royal sceptre and the government of his people, composed of the children of his servant Jacob.
78~David governed this people with a right heart, and directed them with counsel and prudence in all the works that he did for their good.
0~This psalm shows us the miserable state of the Jewish people during the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, in the time of the Machabees. This at least is to be inferred from the first book of the Machabees (7:17), in which the author cites the second verse of our psalm as a prophecy realized in his presence. But, according to St. Augustine, reference is here made to the persecutions that the Church suffered under the pagan emperors.
1~“<l>In hereditatem tuam.</s>” Against Thy people, that is, Thy inheritance. “<l>In pomorum custodiam.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>In acervos lapidum</s>—They have made of it heaps of stone. In the first book of the Machabees, we read as follows: <l>Accepit spolia civitatis, et succendit eam igni, et destruxit domos ejus, et muros ejus in circuitu ... Et Jerusalem non habitabatur, sed erat sicut desertum</s>—He took the spoils of the city and burnt it with fire, and threw down the houses thereof round about ... And Jerusalem was not inhabited, but was like a desert (1 Mach. 1:33; 3:45).
4~“<l>Qui in circuitu nostro sunt.</s>” Namely, the Moabites, the Edomites, the Ammonites, and other Gentiles.
5~“<l>In finem.</s>” According to the Hebrew and Chaldee: <l>In perpetuum.</s> “<l>Zelus.</s>” Tirinus explains this to be: <l>Indignatio</s>—Indignation. “<l>Velut ignis.</s>” Like fire which is not extinguished till it has reduced everything to ashes, says Bellarmine: <l>Qui crescere solet in immensum, et in cinerem omnia reiligere.</s>
7~“<l>Jacob.</s>” The children of Jacob, that is. Thy people. “<l>Locum ejus.</s>” Their country; or, according to the Hebrew, their Temple.
8~“<l>Anticipent nos misericordiæ tuæ.</s>” That is: Prevent by Thy mercy the ruin with which our enemies threaten us.
9~“<l>Propter gloriam nominis tui ... propter nomen tuum.</s>” Not for our merits, but for the glory of Thy name. “<l>Libera nos.</s>” Deliver us from the miseries in which we are. “<l>Propitius esto peccatis nostris.</s>” Pardon us our sins which have drawn this persecution upon us.
10,11~“<l>Innotescat ... Ultio sanguinis servorum tuorum.</s>” Let Thy justice be manifest to all, by avenging the blood of Thy servants.
12~“<l>Posside filios.</s>” Possess, that is, preserve the children who have escaped from slaughter.
13~“<l>Vicinis nostris.</s>” To those enemies who are our neighbors. Some think that these are Edomites and Philistines; some others, as Bellarmine, those that brought ruin upon Jerusalem under Antiochus, king of Syria. “<l>Septuplum.</s>” Sevenfold, or many times as much, or simply the double, expressing a complete retribution. “<l>In sinu eorum.</s>” In the centre of their hearts.
0~We find in this psalm, according as we take it in the literal or the mystical sense, the prayer which the Jews who were prisoners addressed to God for their deliverance, or which the patriarchs offered up, that the Messias might put an end to the tyranny of the devil.
1~“<l>Qui regis Israel.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>O Pastor Israel!</s> or, according to St. Jerome: <l>Qui pascis Israel:</s> O God, who as a shepherd rulest and feedest the people of Israel. “<l>Intende.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Ausculta:</s> Hear, Thou who guidest as Thy flock the posterity of Joseph. “<l>Ovem.</s>” The Hebrew word, though singular, denotes a multitude, as Menochius remarks. “<l>Joseph.</s>” Menochius and Tirinus give the reasons why under the name of Joseph are comprised all the Israelites, descendants of Joseph and of his brethren (See Psalm 76:14).
2~“<l>Qui sedes super Cherubim.</s>” That is: Thou to whom the first angels in heaven serve as a throne. “<l>Manifestare.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Splende, Inclarescere</s>—Make Thy power brilliantly shine forth. “<l>Coram Ephrem, Benjamin, et Manasse.</s>” By these three tribes are meant the whole people of Israel, according to the explanation of Bellarmine and others.
3~“<l>Excita potentiam tuam.</s>” Awake Thy power; for, as Bellarmine explains, it seems to be asleep, when Thou permittest our enemies to afflict us in this way. “<l>Ut salvos facias nos.</s>” By delivering us from this captivity.
4~“<l>Converte nos.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Reduc nos</s>—Make us recover our liberty. “<l>Ostende faciem tuam.</s>” Look upon us with a benign countenance. This verse is thus well rendered by Mattei: “<si>Signor, da questi carceri, Deh per pieta richiamaci; Un sol tuo sguardo bastaci, E sarem salvi e liberi.</s>”—Ah! from these prisons forth, O Lord, In pity lead us, home restored; Enough, one gracious look from Thee, To save and set us captives free.
5~“<l>Servi tui.</s>” That is: Of Thy people; as Bossuet and others explain with St. Jerome.
6~“<l>In mensura.</s>” Bellarmine says that some misunderstand this phrase, as though it meant: With moderation; for the Hebrew word here means something great and multiplied, that is, in very full measure.
8~Repetition of verse 4.
9~Thou hast brought Thy vine, that is, Thy people, out of Egypt into the land of promise, after having driven therefrom the Gentiles; and there Thou hast planted it, that is to say, the Synagogue, which was the figure of the Christian Church.
10~“<l>Dux itineris fuisti in conspectu ejus.</s>” Lallemant translates thus: Thou didst convey (wert conductor of) this vine in the journey, without ever losing sight of it. But others more commonly continue the allegory, following the sense of the Hebrew text, namely: <l>Præparasti locum coram ea;</s> or, according to St. Jerome: <l>Præparasti ante faciem ejus.</s> Hence they translate: Thou hast prepared this land for this vine. <l>Plantasti radices,</s> etc. And Thou hast caused it to take such good root, that it has filled all this land.
11~“<l>Arbusta.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Rami.</s> “<l>Cedros Dei.</s>” That is, according to Bellarmine and Lallemant: <l>Cedros altissimas</s>—The most lofty cedars, as were those of Lebanon.
12~“<l>Mare.</s>” The Mediterranean. “<l>Flumen</s>” The Euphrates. Such is the interpretation of Bellarmine, Lallemant, and others.
14~“<l>Aper de silva.</s>” Euthymius, Bellarmine, Malvenda, Mattei, and others understand by the wild boar Nabuchodonozor; and, allegorically, according to St. Jerome, it is the devil. “<l>Singularis ferus.</s>” Bellarmine, Mattei, and others say that according to the Hebrew phrase these words designate the same wild boar; it is the ordinary repetition.
15~“<l>Vide, et visita vineam.</s>” Consider our miseries, and visit with Thy compassion this vine thus brought to ruin.
16~“<l>Super Filium hominis.</s>” According to the Chaldee version: <l>Propter Regem Christum.</s> We beg Thee for the love of the Son of man; that is, the Messias, whom Thou hast confirmed; that is, hast established, as Thy Son. It is thus that St. Jerome, St. Augustine, Theodoret, Euthymius, Bellarmine, etc., explain this verse.
17~“<l>Ab increpatione vultus tui peribunt.</s>” Some, as Estius, Sa, and Bossuet, explain this passage thus: But those that have thus laid it waste shall perish through the wrath of Thy angry countenance. Others, more commonly, as Malvenda, Menochius, Rotigni, Tirinus, and Mattei, with Vatablus, Genebrard, Maldonatus, and Mariana, apply it to the Jewish people in this sense: If Thy countenance continues to appear threatening, and to show forth Thy wrath, all those that belong to the Synagogue will perish.
18~Cause Thy power to be known upon the Man of Thy right hand; and upon the Son of man whom Thou hast willed for Thy glory to send into the world to restore Thy vineyard.
19~“<l>Discedimus.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Recedemus.</s> “<l>Vivificabis nos.</s>” Thou wilt give us the strength to serve Thee.
20~Repetition of verses 4 and 8.
0~The psalmist reproves the people for the negligence with which they celebrate the praises of the Lord, and urges them to celebrate them with devotion and in thanksgiving for the benefits received from the Lord; for this end the feasts are instituted. Every Christian can apply this psalm to himself.
3~“<l>Neomenia.</s>” We should here remark, that the Hebrews celebrated every month the Feast of the New Moon; but the most solemn Feast of the New Moon was in September, when the trumpets were sounded, and hence it was called the Feast of Trumpets: <l>Dies clangoris est et tubarum</s> (Num. 29:1). “<l>Vestræ.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Nostræ</s>—Our.
4~In the Book of Numbers (10:10).
5~“<l>In Joseph.</s>” That is: On the posterity of Joseph and his brethren; that is, on the people of Israel. “<l>Linguam quam non noverat.</s>” A language which he did not know, because this was the first time that God spoke to his people.
6~According to the Hebrew: <l>Liberavi ab onere dorsum ejus, et manus ejus a cophinis cessaverunt.</s> The prophet recalls to mind the burdens, the baskets full of mud and bricks, that the Israelites were condemned to carry.
7~Here it is God that speaks. “<l>Exaudivi te in abscondito tempestatis.</s>” This passage is variously interpreted. Mattei understands it as referring to the chastisements that God poured upon the enemies of his people; but I prefer the view of Genebrardus, who explains it thus: I heard thee in the tempest of afflictions which thou didst suffer at the hands of the Egyptians, when it seemed to thee that I hid myself away, and did not hear thy prayer. (This applies well to souls in a state of desolation, to whom it appears as if God does not hear them any more, whilst the Lord in the midst of this storm secretly, that is, without letting them know it, listens to them and helps them.) “<l>Probavi te apud aquam contradictionis.</s>” And yet I tried them and found them to be unfaithful near the water of Meriba. The Hebrew word <l>Meriba,</s> meaning contradiction or strife, and so translated in the Vulgate, is the name of the place where the people, suffering from the want of water, contradicted Moses and first refused to obey him. Thus says Mattei and others.
8~“<l>Contestabor te.</s>” Bellarmine explains: <l>Testatum faciam tibi quid a te requiram.</s> “<l>Si audieris me.</s>” If thou wilt obey me. “<l>Neque adorabis deum alienum.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Et non adores deum peregrinum.</s>
9~“<l>Dominus Deus tuus.</s>” Thy only Lord and God. “<l>Dilata os tuum.</s>” That is: Enlarge thy desires, and ask of me what thou wilt. “<l>Implebo illud.</s>” I will satisfy thee fully.
10~“<l>Non intendit.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Non acquievit,</s> or according to St. Jerome: <l>Non credidit,</s> that is, would not rest satisfied with believing my word.
11~“<l>Secundum desideria cordis eorum.</s>” That is, according to their disordered appetites. “<l>Ibunt in adinventionibus suis.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Ambulabunt in consiliis suis</s>—They will walk to their ruin through following their evil designs.
14~“<l>Mentiti sunt ei.</s>” They have failed in keeping their word to him.
15~“<l>Ex adipe frumenti.</s>” With the flower of the flow of wheat. “<l>De petra melle.</s>” With honey gathered from the rocks; that is, in abundance, since the bees had even made their honey in the midst of rocks.
0~It is God whom the prophet makes speak in this psalm; he reproaches the princes and the judges of the earth for their evil administration of justice, and places before them the moment of death, when they themselves will have to be judged. The last verse shows us Jesus Christ coming to judge all men at the end of the world.
1~“<l>Deorum.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Judicum.</s> “<l>Deos dijudicat.</s>” He weighs the judgments that they render.
2~Here God is speaking to the judges. “<l>Facies peccatorum sumitis?</s>” Bellarmine says that <l>Sumere faciem alicujus in judicio,</s> is to judge, not according to the rule that justice demands, but according to the pleasure of him whom the judge wishes to favor. But Mattei says that <l>Sumere faciem peccatorum,</s> according to the proper sense of the Hebrew expression, signifies: <l>Erigere faciem peccatorum,</s> and says he, when judges favor the wicked, they cause the wicked to hold up their head; that is, their pride.
4~“<l>De manu peccatoris.</s>” From the hands of the sinner who is more powerful and would oppress them.
5~The wicked judges do not understand these maxims; they walk in the dark, and they put all the world in confusion by their unjust practices.
6~O judges! I have set you up as gods of the earth, by giving you a share of my own power; by virtue of this authority that you have received from the Most High, you are his sons.
7~But take note that you are men, and as men you have all to die, and one day each one of you will fall from his post, as the princes who went before you have fallen.
8~“<l>Hereditabis in omnibus gentibus.</s>” Thy reign shall extend over all the nations as Thy heritage, and at the last day all these must submit to Thy justice and power.
0~We have in this psalm the prayer that the Jewish people addressed to God, asking him for help against the Ammonites, the Moabites, and other Gentiles, who threatened to ruin the Temple and the holy city. This psalm may be used to pray to the intention of the Church whenever she suffers any special persecution.
1~“<l>Quis similis erit tibi?</s>” Who shall have power to do what Thou canst? “<l>Neque compescaris.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Et non quiescas.</s> Hide not Thy just indignation by keeping silence and peace.
2~“<l>Sonuerunt.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Tumultuati sunt.</s>
3~“<l>Malignaverunt consilium.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Nequiter tractaverunt.</s> “<l>Sanctos tuos.</s>” Those that adore Thee.
4~“<l>Disperdamus eos de gente.</s>” According to Mattei, this is a Hebraism, which means: Let us remove this people from the world.
5~“<l>Testamentum disposuerunt.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Fædus pepigerunt.</s> “<l>Tabernacula.</s>” That is, the tents or the camp, the troops.
6~“<l>Alienigenæ.</s>” The strangers, or foreigners.
7~“<l>Etenim Assur.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Sed et Assur.</s> And even the host of the Assyrians. “<l>Filiis Lot.</s>” Mattei says that hereby we can only understand the Ammonites, the descendants of Ammon, son of Lot.
8~“<l>Madian.</s>” The Madianites, defeated by Gedeon (Jud. 7:20).
10~Oreb and Zeb, two of the chiefs of the Madianites, were slain by the Hebrews (Jud. 7:25). Zebee and Salmana, their kings, were killed by Gedeon himself (Jud. 8:21).
11~“<l>Hæreditate possideamus sanctuarium Dei.</s>” Let us go to take possession of the Sanctuary of God, that is, Jerusalem, as an inheritance that belongs to us.
12~“<l>Pone illos ut rotam.</s>” Lallemant thus interprets these words: Send upon them a spirit of giddiness, to disconcert them. “<l>Sicut stipulam ante faciem venti.</s>” Scatter them as a heap of straw is scattered before the wind. Such is the explanation also given by Mattei.
13~“<l>Flamma comburens montes.</s>” Genebrard and Rotigni understand this of volcanoes, as Vesuvius and Etna, which cause general devastation by the flames they send forth. Bellarmine understands it of the dry grass burning on the mountains; but Lallemant and Mattei interpret it of the lightning that strikes the mountains and sets then on fire.
14~St. Jerome translates: <l>Sic persequere eos in tempestate tua, et in turbine tuo conturba eos</s>—So pursue them with the tempest of Thy vengeance, and confuse them with the whirlwind of Thy wrath.
15~“<l>Quærent nomen tuum.</s>” That is, they will enter into themselves and be converted to Thee. But others more commonly explain it thus: They will ask to know Thy name, that is, Thy power; they will be instructed therein, and they will venerate it.
16~If this is not enough to bring about their conversion, let them remain troubled with continual fear of Thy power all their lives, and let them die in confusion.
17~Let them know that the name of the Lord belongs properly to Thee alone, since Thou alone art King of kings throughout the earth.
0~This psalm shows us with what ardor the psalmist, desolate in finding himself far from the Temple of Jerusalem, sighed after the moment of seeing it again. And as the Temple was the figure of heaven, one must believe that he sighed at the same time after the happiness of going to contemplate God in the heavenly kingdom. Nothing is more fitted than this psalm to excite in us the desire of leaving the earth, and of entering the abode of the blessed.
1~“<l>Atria Domini.</s>” See verse 10.
2~That is: My soul and my body leap for joy in thinking of Thee, O living God! Our God is called the living God, in contrast with the gods of the Gentiles, who are dead gods.
3,4~For the sparrow finds its dwelling in some house, and the turtle a nest in which it places its young in safety; and cannot I retire near Thy altars, that is, in Thy Temple, which would be my happy asylum and my happy nest.—This is thus understood by Bellarmine, Maldonatus, and Lallemant. Mattei translates: <l>Altaria tua</s>—Thy altar was my nest, my haven.
6~This is the sense that St. Augustine gives to this verse: Happy the man that hopes to receive from Thee the help that he needs, having resolved in his heart to rise more and more to higher degrees of perfection, as long as he is in this valley of tears,—a place where God has placed him to gain merit. But Mattei with Bossuet interprets this in a very different manner. He says that the psalmist, sighing to return from Babylon to Jerusalem, imagines that he is already free, and exclaims: Happy he that hopes for and obtains Thy help; he already returns, he passes by the valley of Bocha, and is there refreshed by the water that Thou causest to rain down. The same author gives afterwards some explanations: 1. “<l>Ascensiones.</s>” This word, according to the Hebrew, expresses the return to Jerusalem, and it is this that the prophet represents to himself in spirit: “<l>In corde suo.</s>” 2. “<l>Disposuit.</s>” A verb that is found joined to the following words: “<l>In valle lacrymarum,</s>” which are expressed in Hebrew by the name of <l>Bocha,</s> which was an arid valley, called the Place of Tears: <l>Locus flentium, sive Lacrymarum</s> (Jud. 2:5. In the Hebrew we read: <l>Bochim</s>). 3. “<l>In loco quem posuit.</s>” Here the Hebrew word instead of <l>Locus</s>—Place, signifies <l>Fons,</s> a Fountain; so that we translate: <l>Fons ibi ponetur</s>—There shall be set a fountain of water.
7~Mattei, following the sense which he gives to the preceding verse, renders this verse as follows: <l>Etenim propitia dabitur pluvia; hinc ibit de cœtu in cœtum, donee videbit Deum deorum in Sion</s>—For a kindly rain shall be granted; and thence he shall go from company to company, till he comes to see the great God in Sion. Thus the psalmist imagining himself refreshed in the valley of Bocha with the water of a most salutary rain, and that he is marching in the midst of the companies of Israelites who are going to Jerusalem, rejoices as if he were already in the Temple and saw the God of gods. But others, following the sense that they at first adopted, give this explanation: For God, who has given the law, which is the road to arrive at life eternal, will give them his blessing; and so they will walk from virtue to virtue till they see the God of gods in the heavenly Sion. What is certain is that these two verses, 6 and 7, are obscure; and interpreters have made them still more so.
9~O God, who art our protector! regard us with a gracious eye, and especially look upon our king, who is the figure of the Saviour whom Thou art to send us. “<l>Christi.</s>” According to Bossuet: <l>Regis, qui est Christi figura</s>—The king who is a figure of Christ. But it may well be understood as applying principally to the Messias.
10~“<l>In atriis tuis.</s>” These words designate the Temple, says Mariana: <l>Sic Templum vocat, in quo varia atria erant</s>—He thus speaks of the Temple, in which there were various courts. Tirinus observes that the Temple allegorically signifies the Church, and anagogically, that is, in a higher spiritual sense, heaven.
11~“<l>In domo Dei mei.</s>” By this house of God Bellarmine with St. Augustine understands heaven; but Bossuet, Mattei, etc., understand the Temple, according to the Hebrew, and is thus translated: <l>Mallem esse custos liminis domus tuæ</s>—I would rather be a doorkeeper of the Temple; that is, amongst its most lowly servants, according to what we read of the most humble offices of the Levites (1 Parall. 9:19, <l>et seq.</s>). “<l>In tabernaculis.</s>” This expression here denotes the great houses, palaces.
12~That is: God is merciful and faithful to his promises; hence he wishes to grant us grace in this life, and glory in the next.
13~“<l>Bonis.</s>” Grace and glory are real good things. “<l>Qui ambulant in innocentia.</s>” Those that live, keeping away from sin.
0~The psalmist goes to show us, on the one hand, the Jewish people delivered from slavery; on the other hand, mankind redeemed from the slavery of Satan. He enumerates, moreover, the fruits of the Redemption. The Church recites this psalm in the office of Christmas, and we ourselves may recite it to obtain that the fruits of the Redemption may be applied to us.
1~“<l>Benedixisti, Domine, terram tuam.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Placatus es, Domine, terræ tuæ</s>—At last, O Lord, Thou hast been appeased in respect to Thy land, and Thou hast blessed it. “<l>Jacob.</s>” Of Jacob, or his children.
2~“<l>Operuisti omnia peccata eorum.</s>” Thou hast covered all their sins; or, as is very well explained by Bellarmine, Thou hast hidden them from Thy face, in order not to see them, nor to punish them. When God covers sins, he effaces them and remits them as if they had never existed. See what has been said in Psalm 31:1.
3~“<l>Avertisti ab ira indignationis tuæ.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Conversus es ab ira furoris tui</s>—Thou hast put off Thy wrath, as Bellarmine explains it; Thou hast turned away from Thy anger and Thy indignation: <l>Avertisti te ab ira et indignatione tua.</s>
4~“<l>Deus salutaris noster.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Deus, Jesus noster.</s>
6~“<l>Deus, tu conversus.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Nonne tu convertens ...?</s> That is: If Thou, O Lord, art appeased, and turnest Thy eyes towards us, Thou wilt give us life, by causing us to rise again from sin to grace; and Thy people will rejoice in Thee, singing Thy praises.
7~“<l>Misericordiam tuam.</s>” The effects of Thy mercy. “<l>Salutare tuum da nobis.</s>” That is, according to Bellarmine and Menochius: Give us salvation by sending us the Saviour, or the expected Messias.
8~“<l>Loquetur pacem in plebem suam.</s>” He will speak of peace for his people, that is, of the reconciliation that Jesus Christ their Redeemer will obtain for them, who is called by Isaias: <l>Princeps pacis</s> (Is. 9:6).
9~He will make me understand that he wishes to save the just, and even the sinners, who entering into themselves will be converted, seriously and with all their heart; according to Bellarmine and Bossuet: <l>Qui serio resipiscunt.</s>
10~“<l>Verumtamen.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Certe, Utique</s>—Surely, of a truth; as Malvenda, Menochius, Sa, Tirinus, and Lallemant observe. “<l>Salutare ipsius.</s>” The salvation that God will give them with the coming of the Messias. “<l>Gloria.</s>” That is: Jesus Christ; <l>Splendor gloriæ</s> (Heb. 1:3). Thus Maldonatus and Malvenda.
11~Mercy and truth, or justice, will meet at the coming of the Messias, so that then justice satisfied and peace bestowed shall embrace each other. St. Jerome and St. Augustine understand by <si>Mercy,</s> the coming of the Saviour for the Gentiles, to whom he was not promised; and by <si>Truth,</s> the faithfulness of the Messias with respect to the Jews, to whom he was promised. We have used the future <si>will meet</s> and <si>will embrace,</s> because in this psalm the coming of the Messias is predicted, as Bellarmine remarks, and the poetical language of the Orientals often expresses the future in the past tense, to denote the certainty of the prophecy.
12~“<l>Veritas de terra orta est.</s>” That is, according to Lallemant: Innocence will again spring up on earth. Others explain it thus: The inhabitants of the earth will embrace the truth, or the true faith. But the interpretation that seems to me better is that of Bellarmine and of Menochius, namely: Truth shall spring from the earth, that is, from the virginal womb of Mary; so also St. Augustine understands it of the Eternal Word, who is the Truth itself, clothing himself with human flesh in the womb of the Blessed Virgin.
13~God in his goodness will send his Son to become man; and our earth, the Blessed Virgin will give us her fruit, Jesus Christ, who was called the fruit of Mary’s womb (Luke 1:42); thus was accomplished the prophecy of Isaias: <l>Aperiatur terra, et germinet Salvatorem</s>—Let the earth be opened, and bud forth a Saviour (Is. 45:8).
14~That is: All his actions and all his steps during his life shall be conformed to rectitude and justice, in order that men by following him may arrive at the country of the Blessed.
0~We have in this psalm one of those fervent prayers that the royal prophet addressed to God in the midst of his tribulations. For, according to the common opinion, David is the author of this psalm. Moreover, he initiates us into the sentiments that filled the soul of Jesus Christ during his Passion, and he prophesies the conversion of the Gentiles. Afflicted souls may use it during their trials to implore the help of God.
2~“<l>Custodit animam meam.</s>” Preserve my life. “<l>Sanctus sum.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Sanctus ego.</s> According to the Syriac version and the Psalter of Milan: <l>Sanctus es;</s> but commonly the interpreters read: <l>Sanctus sum;</s> and Mattei says that we should not depart from the Hebrew. Hence this explanation: I am Thy faithful servant, devoted to Thy service.
3~“<l>Ad te clamavi.</s>” I have cried to Thee by asking Thee for mercy. “<l>Ad te ... animam meam levavi.</s>” Dom Calmet explains: I have desired Thy help with ardor. But Mattei’s translation is better: I have raised my heart to Thee.
4~“<l>Mitis.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Propitiabilis</s>—Ready to be propitiated, to pardon.
5~“<l>Intende voci deprecationis meæ.</s>” Deign to listen to what I ask of Thee.
6~“<l>Exaudisti me.</s>” That is, according to Bellarmine, Menochius, Sa, and Mariana: Thou hast always been willing to hear me.
7~“<l>In diis.</s>” Among all the gods whom men adore.
8~“<l>Venient.</s>” They will come not by leaving the country that they inhabit, but by embracing the faith.
10~“<l>In via tua.</s>” In the way of Thy commandments. “<l>Ingrediar in veritate tua.</s>” Make me to enter it and walk in it with a firm step. Mattei says that according to the Hebrew the word <l>Veritas</s> marks the perfection of anything that is done. “<l>Lætetur cor meum.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Uni cor meum;</s> that is, according to Mattei: <l>Collige cor meum;</s> this agrees with St. Jerome’s translation: <l>Unicum fac cor meum.</s> Unite, gather together to Thyself all the affections of my heart; make my heart to be only for Thee, so that it may fear nothing else than to give Thee displeasure.
12~“<l>Ex inferno inferiori.</s>” That is, according to some: From great dangers which were for me a deep grave. But it is better to understand it, with Gordona, of the depth of hell where are the damned; or the abyss of sin, which according to St. Jerome is a kind of hell.
13~“<l>Synagoga potentiun quæsierunt animam meam.</s>” My powerful enemies have assembled in numbers to seek for me and to take away my life. “<l>Non proposuerunt te in conspectu suo.</s>” They have not set before their eyes that Thou protectest the just and punishest the guilty. This is thus understood by Bellarmine and Lallemant, with St. Augustine.
14~“<l>Verax.</s>” That is: Faithful to Thy promises.
15~“<l>Imperium.</s>” According to the Hebrew Mattei notes: <l>Robur,</s> strength; or following St. Jerome’s translation: <l>Fortitudinem.</s> This passage, as Mariana, Sa, and Rotigni say, may easily apply to Jesus Christ the Son of the Blessed Virgin, who is called herself the servant of the Lord: <l>Ecce ancilla Domini.</s>
0~This psalm is consecrated to the praise of Jerusalem, this glorious city that God had chosen for his dwelling-place. And since Jerusalem is a figure of the Church, the Fathers and the interpreters refer unanimously this psalm to the Catholic Church; built upon the holy mountains, that is, upon the apostles, as St. Jerome, St. Augustine, Theodoret, Euthymius, explain, and as one may infer from these words of St. Paul: <l>Superædificati super fundamentum Apostolorum.</s> Built upon the foundation of the Apostles (Eph. 2:20). This psalm is as obscure as it is short.
1~“<l>Fundamenta ejus.</s>” That is, according to Bellarmine, Mattei, and others: The foundations of the holy city which I contemplate in spirit. “<l>In montibus sanctis.</s>” On the mountains of Sion and Moria, where the Temple is built; hence St. Jerome translates: <l>In montibus sanctuarii.</s> “<l>Portas Sion.</s>” That is to say: The city of Jerusalem. “<l>Tabernacula Jacob.</s>” The habitation of Jacob, that is, according to Menochius, Bossuet, Mattei, Rotigni, etc. : The other cities of Judea.
2~“<l>Gloriosa dicta sunt.</s>” Many glorious things have been said by the prophets; thus, Menochius, Mariana, and Tirinus.
3~God here speaks. “<l>Rahab.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Superbi;</s> but the interpreters, following the Chaldee, commonly understand Egypt. “<l>Scientium me.</s>” The inhabitants of which shall one day know me through the faith, and shall adore me. It is thus explained by Menochius, Lallemant, and several others.
4~“<l>Alienigenæ.</s>” The Philistines. So it is understood by Lallemant, Mariana, and all the interpreters. “<l>Fuerunt.</s>” This past tense expresses here the future: All the people will be there. This is a prophecy that has been well verified in the Church of Jesus Christ by the conversion of the Gentiles, as Mattei observes.
5~This verse is more obscure than the others. “<l>Numquid Sion dicet.</s>” In this phrase Sion is not in the nominative case. St. Jerome translates: <l>Ad Sion autem dicetur;</s> Estius with Symmachus has: <l>De Sion autem dicetur;</s> and Pagnini: <l>Et ipsi Sion dicetur.</s> “<l>Homo et homo.</s>” A Hebraism, which, as Mattei says, can have two senses: it can signify the multiplicity of men, and so it is understood by Lallemant, or the excellence of man, a wise man, a powerful man, etc., as St. Augustine, St. Jerome, Theodoret, Tertullian, and Bellarmine, and others understand it. Hence the verse is explained thus: What! Is there then no one there to say to Sion, that is to Jerusalem, that in the midst of her will be born a Man the most excelling, who will be the Most High, at once God and man, becoming man in the city founded by himself? <l>In ea factus est homo, et ipse eam fundavit.</s> Thus St. Augustine expresses it.
6~The Lord will announce it, that is, will make it known in Holy Scriptures written for the instruction of the people, and especially in the writings of the apostles, who are the princes or the heads of the new Church. Thus following the explanation of Menochius, in these Scriptures shall be preserved the names of those distinguished men who have illustrated her.
7~In a word, O city of God! O holy Church! those that shall dwell in thee will all be filled with joy on account of the peace that they shall enjoy.
0~The coming Passion of Jesus Christ is the subject of this psalm, according to St. Augustine, who says: <l>Domini hic Passio prophetatur.</s> Here, then, under the figure of a soul overwhelmed with sufferings, insults, tribulations, which prays to God to come to its aid, we see Jesus Christ in the midst of his most bitter sufferings and in his total dereliction addressing himself as man to his heavenly Father to ask his help. This is the explanation given by Bellarmine and many others, with St. Jerome and St. Augustine, who makes this remark: <l>Oravit enim et Dominus non secundum formam Dei, sed secundum formam servi: secundum hanc enim passus est</s>—For the Lord, too, prayed: not according to the form of God, but according to the form of a servant; for according to this, too, he suffered. Every soul in desolation can profitably use this psalm to obtain relief from God.
1~“<l>Deus salutis meæ.</s>” God, from whom I look for my salvation.
3~This verse agrees with what Jesus Christ said in the garden of Olives: <l>Tristis est anima mea usque ad mortem</s>—My soul is sorrowful even unto death (Matt. 26:38). It is thus applied by St. Augustine.
4~“<l>Inter mortuos liber.</s>” Here the word <l>Liber</s> gives rise to different interpretations. St. Augustine applies it to Jesus Christ in two ways: first, in the sense of, Free from sin, in contrast with other men who are subject to death by reason of sin: <l>Inter peccatores solus sine peccato</s>—Though among sinners he himself alone without sin; and then in this sense that he died not through necessity, but only by an act of his free will. This second explanation is adopted by Bellarmine and Bossuet; it appears to me to be more adequate according to the letter in relation to Jesus Christ, typified under the person of David. But, speaking literally of the person of David, Mattei says that the words <l>Inter mortuos liber</s> signify: Separate from the other dead. He cites the example of king Azarias, who, on account of his leprosy, dwelt in a free house: <l>in domo libera</s> (4 Kings 15:5); that is, in a free house—<l>in domo separata</s> (2 Parall. 26:21); and Josephus, the historian, attests that the same king when dead was also buried by himself in a place apart: <l>Seorsum solus sepultus est.</s> Hence Mattei, explaining this passage with regard to the person of David, renders it thus: I am reputed as separate even from the other dead, as though unworthy to remain amongst them.
5~“<l>Vulnerati.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Interfecti</s>—Killed. “<l>De manu tua repulsi.</s>” That is, according to Bellarmine and Tirinus: Deprived of all help from Thee.
6~“<l>Posuerunt.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Posuisti.</s> That is: Thou hast permitted that I should be deposed. “<l>In umbra mortis.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>In profundis.</s> According to Bellarmine, the sense is the same: he adds that the words <l>Umbra mortis</s> signify: A shadow so dense as it deprives of all light, like the shadow of death. He says, moreover, with St. Jerome, that this verse, applied to Jesus Christ, may be understood of his descent in Limbo.
7~“<l>Furor.</s>” St. Augustine justly remarks that this word is better rendered by <si>Indignation,</s> because fury (wrath) is ordinarily found in those that have a troubled mind. “<l>Omnes fluctus tuos induxisti super me.</s>” Thou hast heaped upon me all the floods of ills.
8~This was truly accomplished in Jesus Christ when he was abandoned by his disciples: <l>Tune discipuli omnes, relicto eo, fugerunt</s>—Then the disciples, all leaving him, fled (Matt. 26:56). <l>Stabant autem omnes noti ejus a longe</s>—And all his acquaintance ... stood afar off (Luke 23:49).
9~“<l>Traditus sum.</s>” I have been given up to the power of my enemies. “<l>Non egrediebar.</s>” That is, as Bellarmine explains: <l>Non volebam egredi.</s> I did not wish to withdraw myself, my Father having decreed that I should suffer for the salvation of men. “<l>Oculi mei languerunt præ inopia.</s>” That is, according to the same interpreter: My eyes have become faint, as if drained by reason of shedding tears.
10~To ask help according to what the Apostle says: <l>Preces supplicationesque, ad eum qui possit illum salvum facere a morte, cum clamore valido et lacrymis offerens</s>—Who in the days of his flesh with a strong cry and tears offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death (Heb. 5:7).
12~“<l>Veritatem tuam.</s>” Thy fidelity to Thy promises. “<l>In perditione.</s>” After having lost his life.
13~Can the admirable prodigies of Thy goodness and justice be known in the darkness of the tomb and in this place of forgetfulness, to render Thee the homage that is due to Thee?
14~“<l>Mane oratio mea præveniet te.</s>” I will not cease to present to Thee my prayers from the break of day.
15~This may be understood of the prayer that Jesus Christ made in the garden of Olives: <l>Transeat a me calix iste</s>—May this chalice pass from me; a prayer that his Father did not hear because our Redeemer wished effectively to die, to save man; for, says Bellarmine, had the Son prayed absolutely, the Father would certainly have heard him.
16~“<l>Exaltatus autem, humiliatus sum et conturbatus.</s>” That is: No sooner have I received some relief than immediately I saw myself humbled and weighed down with afflictions.
17~“<l>Conturbaverunt me.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Oppresserunt me.</s> That is: I am crushed under the blows of Thy justice, on account of the rigor with which all the sins of men have deserved to be punished.
19~“<l>A miseria.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Ab obscuritate, a tenebris.</s> Hence this explanation that Mattei gives with Marco Marino: <l>Tenebris se abdunt, ne videantur a me</s>—They hide themselves, not to be seen by me and obliged to help me in my misery.
0~St. Jerome divides this psalm into three parts. The first recalls the promise, several times repeated, which God made to David to maintain always royalty in the family. The second teaches us that this promise was not entirely fulfilled in the sons according to the flesh, nor in the temporal kingdom of David. The third shows us the prophet sighing for the coming of the Messias, in whom all was to be fully realized, since he alone was to put an end to the tribulations of his people. This is the reason why the Church recites this psalm in the Office of Christmas.
2~“<l>Veritatem tuam.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Fidem tuam</s>—Thy fidelity to Thy promises.
3~“<l>In æternum misericordia ædificabitur.</s>” That is: Mercy shall be for us an eternal edifice of graces. “<l>Præparabitur.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Stabilietur</s>—Shall be established. “<l>Veritas tua.</s>” That is: Thy fidelity, or the accomplishment of Thy promises.
4~“<l>Disposui testamentum.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Percussi fœdus.</s> “<l>Electis meis.</s>” With my elect; namely, Abraham, Isaac, and the other Patriarchs, as is commonly understood by interpreters. “<l>Præparabo.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Stabiliam.</s> God has promised (2 Kings 7:12) to intrust forever his kingdom to the posterity of David, and this promise was verified in the person of Jesus Christ, as is taught by St. Jerome, St. Augustine, Theodoret, etc. Mattei observes very well that the kingdom of David was perpetuated in Jesus Christ, his descendant, who has continued and will continue eternally to maintain and to govern the spiritual empire of the Church.
5~That is: I will establish for thee a royal throne through all ages. Bellarmine justly remarks that this was properly verified only in our Saviour, of whom David was the figure.
6~“<l>Etenim.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Et, Etiam.</s> “<l>Veritatem tuam.</s>” Thy fidelity to the promises that Thou hast made.
7~“<l>In nubibus.</s>” That is: In the heavens. “<l>In filiis Dei.</s>” According to the Chaldee: Among the angels.
8~“<l>Sanctorum.</s>” That is: Of the angels.
9~“<l>Veritas tua in circuitu tuo.</s>” That is: Thy faithfulness always accompanies Thee. Mattei understands this part of the verse thus: Thou art powerful; and therefore Thou dost promise much, and Thou art faithful to fulfil Thy promises.
10~“<l>Potestati maris.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Superbiæ maris</s>—The pride of the sea.
11~“<l>Vulneratum.</s>” The Hebrew word signifies, according to Menochius: Mortally wounded. “<l>Superbum.</s>” In Hebrew: <l>Rahab.</s> That is: King Pharao, or else Egypt. “<l>Dispersisti.</s>” Thou hast scattered Thine enemies by drowning them in the Red Sea, according to the interpretation of Bellarmine.
12~“<l>Aquilonem et mare.</s>” Bellarmine, Menochius, Lallemant, and Mattei, with Symmachus, hereby understand the North and the South.
13~“<l>Thabor et Hermon.</s>” That is, as Lallemant explains: The East and the West.
14~“<l>Firmetur.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Roboretur.</s> “<l>Præparatio.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Basis;</s> or, according to St. Jerome’s translation: <l>Firmamentum.</s>
15~“<l>Veritas.</s>” Fidelity to Thy promises. “<l>Præcedent faciem tuam.</s>” That is: Are always before Thy eyes. “<l>Beatus populus qui scit jubilationem.</s>” Happy the people that know the joy that is felt in praising Thee ! Thus Bellarmine, Menochius, Tirinus, and Bossuet.
16~That is, according to Bellarmine and Menochius: Those that praise Thee shall walk in the light of Thy grace, in following the way of Thy precepts; they shall exult with joy all the day long in celebrating Thy name; and Thy justice, which will never fail to recompense Thy servants, will elevate them to a higher degree of perfection.
17~Thou art the glory of their virtue, since all their vigor comes from Thy grace, and not from their own works; and it is only by Thy good pleasure that our strength will be raised against the enemy. “<l>In beneplacito tuo exaltabitur.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>In voluntate tua elevabis</s>—In Thy will shalt Thou raise up. “<l>Cornu.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Robur</s>—Our strength.
18~“<l>Assumptio.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Protectio.</s>
19~“<l>Sanctis tuis.</s>” To ye holy prophets. According to the Hebrew: <l>Sancto tuo;</s> which may be understood of the prophet Samuel; but Malvenda, Lallemant, and Mattei say that the other prophets may also be very well understood in accordance with the Vulgate. “<l>In potente.</s>” In a mighty man, who is David. “<l>Exaltavi.</s>” I have raised him to the throne.
20~“<l>Unxi eum.</s>” I have anointed him, or I will cause him to be anointed as king of Israel; as was done by the ministry of Samuel (1 Kings 16:13).
24~“<l>Veritas mea.</s>” My fidelity to my promises. “<l>In nomine meo.</s>” That is: By my help. The interpreters say that the expressions of this verse and of the following verses apply better to the person of Jesus Christ.
25~That is: I will give him the dominion of the sea and of the rivers. If one wishes to apply to David this verse, one may understand by the Sea the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Gulf, or the Red Sea, and the whole Erythraean Sea, where the Edomites, the Amalekites, and the Arabs, all tributaries of David, lived; and by the rivers, the Euphrates, the Orontes, and others subject to David, when he took Syria, Mesopotamia, and Damascus. But Maldonatus, Bellarmine, Menochius, and many others apply the verse better to Jesus Christ, of whom David was the figure, and to whom God made subject the seas, the rivers, and the whole earth.
26~Jesus Christ, speaking of God, calls him his Father, as to his divinity, and his God, his Saviour, as to his humanity. Such is the explanation given by Bellarmine and Menochius.
27~Bellarmine and Menochius say that Jesus Christ as God is the only Begotten, and that as man he is the First-born, because he was the Head of the predestined (Eph. 1). Others apply this verse to the person of David. Mattei justly remarks that in the spiritual sense the expressions in the verse are fully verified only in Jesus Christ.
28~St. Augustine also applies this verse to the person of Jesus Christ, saying: <l>Propter ipsum fidele testamentum;</s> which means that God on account of the merits of Jesus Christ kept his promise to save mankind. But others commonly apply it to David in this sense: I will be faithful to him in the promise that I have made him; namely, to give him a Son who shall be Jesus Christ, through whom his reign shall become eternal. This promise was made to David by the prophet Nathan (2 Kings 7:12). Such is the explanation given by Bellarmine and Menochius.
29~This verse corresponds to what we read in the Gospel: <l>Dabit illi Domimis Deus sedem David, patris ejus; et regnabit in domo Jacob in æternum, et regni ejus non erit finis</s>—The Lord shall give unto him the throne of David, his father; and he shall reign in the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end (Luke 1:32,33). It also corresponds to the prophecy of Isaias: <l>Super solium David et super regnum ejus sedebit, ut confirmet illud, et corroboret in judicio et justitia, a modo et usque in sempiternum</s>—He shall sit upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom; to establish it and strengthen it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth and forever (Is. 9:7). Jesus Christ was, in fact, to reign over all Israel and over the whole earth; not, indeed, with a temporal rule, which it was not his will to exercise, but with a spiritual rule, of which the earthly kingdom of David was a figure. Hence the verse may be thus explained: I will preserve his race by giving him the Messias for his son, through Whom I will make his throne to endure as long as the heavens; that is, forever. Gordona here remarks that the temporal reign of David ended under Jechonias; whence, he says, this promise of an eternal kingdom can be understood only of Jesus Christ typified by David.
32~ The Lord threatens the rod and stripes, and not the sword and death, to show that he will come as a father to correct, and not as an executioner to take their life.
33~“<l>Misericordiam autem meam non dispergam ab eo.</s>” That is, the offence that the descendants of David will inflict upon me will not prevent me from keeping my promise of causing the Messias to be born in his family. “<l>Neque nocebo in veritate mea.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Non mentiar in veritate mea</s>—I will not fail in the promise that I have made to him.
35~“<l>Juravi in sancto meo.</s>” Mattei observes that this is a recognized expression in Scripture; thus we read: <l>Juravit Dominus Deus in sancto suo</s>—The Lord God hath sworn by his holiness (Amos 4:2). “<l>Si David mentiar.</s>” The same interpreter says that in the imprecatory oaths the Hebrews left the second part of the imprecation to be understood; so that <l>Si mentiar</s> means the same as <l>Non mentiar;</s> it is as if God said: If I lie, I am no longer God. “<l>Semen ejus in æternum manebit.</s>” His posterity shall never come to an end, since Jesus Christ shall reign for all eternity.
36~“<l>Testis in cælo fidelis.</s>” That is, according to Bellarmine and Menochius: Like the rainbow which appears in heaven as a faithful witness of the peace which God wishes to keep with men (Gen. 9:16). But Lallemant explains it thus: This throne placed in heaven for the Son of David shall be there forever, a faithful witness of the truth of my promises.
37~“<l>Distulisti Christum tuum.</s>” Thou hast deferred sending the Messias whom Thou hast promised. St. Augustine says in regard to this passage: <l>Ergo, Domine, non imples quod promisisti</s>—Art Thou not, Lord, going to fulfil what Thou hast promised? He then adds: <l>Manet omnino, Deus, quod promisisti; nam Christum tuum non abstulisti, sed distulisti</s>—Thou still keepest Thy promise, for Thou hast not cast off Thy Christ, but Thou hast delayed him.
38~“<l>Sanctuarium.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Diadema.</s> The verse is thus explained: It seems as if Thou hast revoked the covenant and the promise Thou hast made to Thy servant David; for Thou hast permitted Thy sanctuary to be profaned on earth, by allowing the crown to pass into the hands of a Gentile king, who has seized upon the throne. This happened when Jechonias and Sedecias, descendants of David, were taken captive. But St. Augustine, Bede, Cassiodorus, and others, apply this text to the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.
39~“<l>Destruxisti omnes sepes ejus.</s>” Thou hast willed all the walls of the kingdom of David to be ruined, so that it remained as a vineyard without hedges. “<l>Posuisti firmamentum ejus formidinem.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Posuisti in munitionibus ejus formidinem;</s> or, according to the translation of St. Jerome: <l>Posuisti munitiones ejus pavorem.</s> That is: Thou hast set fear in the place of the fortresses of the kingdom. Thus Lallemant explains it: <l>Fecisti ut in locum munitionis succederet formido</s>—Thou hast caused terror to take the place of defence.
41~“<l>Exaltasti dexteram.</s>” Thou hast increased the strength, the power.
42~St. Augustine, applying this passage to the destruction of the Jewish people, and to the ruin of their kingdom for having put to death Jesus Christ, exclaims: <l>Terram perdidit, pro qua Dominum occidit!</s>—It has lost that land for which it killed the Lord!
43~We translate this verse as Father Lallemant does. But St. Augustine explains differently the words “<l>Destruxisti eum ab emundatione;</s>” he says that the Jews not believing in Jesus Christ remained deprived of the grace which would have purified them: <l>Soluti sunt ab emundatione;</s> for faith alone was able to purify their hearts from their sins.
44~“<l>Minorasti dies temporis ejus.</s>” St. Augustine says that the Jews believed that their kingdom would last forever: <l>Putabant se in æternum regnaturos.</s>
45~“<l>Avertis.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Absconderis</s>—Wilt Thou hide Thyself? “<l>In finem?</s>” Is it to be until our ruin is complete? The sense of the verse is: How long, O Lord, wilt Thou refuse to look graciously upon us? Is Thy anger, then, like fire, which is not quenched until it has utterly consumed whatsoever it lays hold of? Thus Lallemant explains the words with Bellarmine.
46~“<l>Memorare quæ mea substantia.</s>” Bellarmine thus translates the Hebrew: <l>Memorare ego quanti temporis sim</s>—Consider how short the time is that remains for me to live. St. Augustine, explaining these words with reference to Jesus Christ, makes David say: Remember, O Lord, what is my substance, that is, that Thy Son is to take flesh from my blood.
48~“<l>In veritate tua.</s>” That is, according to Thy fidelity.
49~“<l>Quod continui in sinu meo.</s>” Mattei explains: <l>Quibus opprobriis plenus est sinus meus</s>—Of which reproach my own heart is full.
50~“<l>Commutationem.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Claudicationem</s>—Limping. That is: Thy enemies, O Lord, upbraid us, and for what? Because Thy Christ, or the Messias, comes limping with too slow a pace. When the Gentiles insulted the Jews, the latter answered them that the Messias would soon come to deliver them from their miseries; but the Gentiles, continuing their reproaches, rejoined: How is this? Is your Messias lame, that he never arrives?
51~That is: But may the Lord be blessed forever, for he cannot fail in his promises; let us, then, humbly pray to him to accomplish with all speed the promise that he has made to send us the Saviour.
0~According to St. Jerome, it is Moses who in this psalm represents to God the brevity and the miseries of human life, and prays to him to have pity on his people. Other interpreters, however, apply it to the Jews who are captives at Babylon and implore help from God.
1~Thou hast been at all times our refuge, and Thou wilt be so to the end.
2~Thou hast ever been and wilt ever be the God that Thou art.
3~Some explain this verse thus: Do not Thou suffer that men should turn their back upon Thee to give themselves up to worthless creatures; for Thou hast said to them: O men! turn ye unto me, and I will make you feel the effects of my mercy. But others, as Maldonatus, Bossuet, Mattei, etc., follow the Hebrew text, which says: <l>Convertis hominem in pulverem,</s> or, according to St. Jerome: <l>Convertes hominem usque ad contritionem, et dices: Convertimini,</s> or <l>Revertimini, filii Adam;</s> and they explain the verse thus: Thou, O Lord, art eternal; but Thou hast ordained that all men should one day return to the dust out of which they are formed. This explanation is founded on the Hebrew text; but the former, which follows the Vulgate, appears more simple and natural.
4~Even if we were to live a thousand years, what more would these be in Thy sight, that is, compared with Thy eternity, than as yesterday which is already past? Such is the explanation that the learned commonly give, as Malvenda thus attests: <l>Omnes fere.</s>
5~All these thousand years are no more than one of the four watches into which the night is divided, and which are counted as nothing; what then do all the years of men count when compared with eternity?
6~St. Jerome translates: <l>Mane floruit et abiit; ad vesperam conteretur atque siccabitur</s>—The life of man is like a blade of grass that soon passes; in the morning it flourishes and in the evening it falls, withers, and dries up.
7~Such is our lot, because by our sins we have provoked Thy wrath; we have become mortal, and we are afflicted by the horror and the fear of death on account of Thy just anger. So it is explained by Bellarmine and many others.
8~When God wills to punish the sinner, he keeps his eyes fixed on his faults; when, on the contrary, he wills to show him mercy, he turns away his eyes in order not to see them: <l>Avertit faciem.</s> It is for this reason that David says in Psalm 1.: <l>Avertit faciem tuam a peccatis meis</s>—Turn away Thy face from my sins. “<l>In illuminatione vultus tui.</s>” Thou exposest to the light and examinest our most secret faults. These explanations are given by Bellarmine, Lallemant, etc.
9~That is: Our life is shortened, and we succumb under the weight of Thy wrath which we have excited by our sins. This is the sense given by Bellarmine and Menochius.
10~Our life is like the web which the spider wastes its own self to make, and which is destroyed by the least touch. As to the number of our years, they do not generally exceed seventy. “<l>Anni nostri sicut aranea meditabuntur.</s>” The Hebrew according to Bellarmine is: <l>Anni nostri sicut meditatio;</s> and according to St. Jerome: <l>Consumpsimus annos nostros quasi sermonem loquens.</s> But these different renderings signify the same thing, namely, that our life passes away like a thought, a meditation, or like a word that is over the moment that it is uttered.
12~When we shall reach that age, seeing ourselves near death we shall correct the sentiments of pride which we had during our life. This interpretation will agree with the Hebrew text, which is thus rendered: <l>Quoniam tonsio celeriter, et avolabimus.</s>—For quickly is the cutting off, and we have fled away. And with St. Jerome: <l>Transibimus cito, et avolabimus</s>—We have passed away quickly and have fled.
13~Who has ever understood how great, O Lord! is the power of Thy wrath, and who can measure the greatness of Thy indignation, which surpasses all that we can conceive, and all that is commonly believed?
14~Make us know the strength of Thy arm, and cause us to be fully informed of Thy avenging justice; and thus made wise we shall come to Thee. St. Jerome translates it thus: <l>Sic ostende, et veniemus corde sapienti</s>—Thus show to us, and we shall come to Thee with a wise heart.
15~Turn to us with a gracious countenance; how long wilt Thou show Thyself in anger? Suffer Thyself to be moved by the prayers of Thy servants.
16~And thus we shall at once see ourselves filled with Thy mercy; we shall exult with joy and we shall be glad all the days of our life.
18~“<l>In servos tuos et in opera tua.</s>” That is, according to Menochius and Tirinus: Upon Thy servants, who are the work of Thy hands—“<l>Et dirige filios eorum.</s>” Look graciously upon their children, and direct them in the way of salvation.
19~May the grace of our Lord shine upon us: direct in us our actions and all that we do.
0~The psalmist here exhorts those that have put all their hope in God to fear no danger. This psalm is somewhat in the form of a dialogue; for the psalmist, the just man, and God himself speak successively.
1~He that lives in the confidence of the help of God shall be assured of his protection.
3~“<l>Venantium.</s>” That is: Of enemies who sought to make me their prey. “<l>A verbo aspero.</s>” Some interpret this of every calamity; Bellarmine, with others, understands it of the condemnation of the reprobate, that is, of the sentence of eternal death.
4~If thou trustest in the Lord, he will cover thee with his shoulders, that is, with his wings, and under the wings of his protection thou mayest hope to be sheltered from every danger.
5,6~“<l>Veritas ejus.</s>” The faithfulness of his promises. “<l>A timore nocturno.</s>” Of the secret plots of thy enemies. “<l>A sagitta volante in die,</s>” Of arrows that shall be shot at thee unexpectedly during the day, that is, sudden and unforeseen dangers. “<l>A negotio perambulante in tenebris.</s>” All hurtful things brought about by unknown causes. “<l>Ab incursu et dæmonio meridiano.</s>” Of any assault of the devil, made with open attack in the middle of the day. In a word, as St. Augustine says, if God protects thee, thou wilt not have to fear any evil planned against thee, by day or by night, in public or in private, whether on the part of men or of demons.
7~Thou shalt see thy enemies fall around thee in great number, and they will not be able to hurt thee.
8~With thy eyes thou shalt see the protection of God over thee, and the vengeance that he will take of thy unjust persecutors.
9~And whereas thou hast trusted in the Lord, saying: O Lord, thou art my hope; thou hast procured for thyself a most high refuge, that is, one most safe, wherein thou hast nothing to fear.
10~Know that here no evil shall happen to thee, and no scourge shall come nigh thy dwelling.
11,12~For the Lord has commended thee to his angels, that they may guard thee in all thy ways: if even thou art in some perilous road, they will bear thee up in their hands, so that thy feet may not chance to stumble against any stone of scandal, that is, any dangerous occasion of sin.
13~That is: Thou wilt have nothing to fear from evil encounters. In a spiritual sense, by the asp is understood the demon who inspires despair; by the basilisk, the demon who inspires presumption; by the lion, pride; and by the dragon, attachment to earthly goods.
14~“<l>Cognovit.</s>” He has known and invoked.
16~I will give him a long life, and will make him enjoy the health and salvation that I shall bestow upon him in this life, and eternal salvation which I reserve for him in the next.
0~David here exhorts the people to praise God for the protection that he has given to the just, and for the chastisements inflicted on sinners in order to correct them.
1~It is just to give glory to God by rendering him thanks for his benefits, and by singing his praises.
2~“<l>Veritatem tuam.</s>” Thy faithfulness to Thy promises.
3~“<l>In decachordo psalterio.</s>” Mariana and Sa understand thereby two different instruments, following in this the Hebrew, which St. Jerome thus translates: “<l>In decachordo et in psalterio.</s>” But Bellarmine thinks that the copulative particle in the Hebrew is redundant; he depends, moreover, on the version of the Septuagint, and on other like expressions that we find in Psalms 32:2, and 143:10.
4~“<l>In factura tua, et in operibus manuum tuarum.</s>” Mattei says with reason that these two expressions are synonymous.
5~“<l>Magnificata.</s>” According to the Chaldee: Magnified, magnificent. “<l>Cogitationes tuæ.</s>” Thy thoughts, or, according to Sa and Mariana, Thy counsels; or with Menochius, the designs of Thy Providence. “<l>Nimis profundæ.</s>” Impenetrable to our weak intelligence.
7,8~“<l>Apparuerint.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Floruerint.</s> Explanation of these two verses: When sinners are born into this world, they are multiplied as the grass which grows up thick apace; and when all the wicked have made a show upon earth, with their dignities and riches, they still perish forever, while Thou, O Lord! shalt ever be the same that Thou art.
10~My strength, or glory, by Thy grace, shall rise on high, as on the head of the unicorn rises its single horn, which is its strength and glory; and my old age shall be consoled by Thy mercy, abounding in gifts and helps.
11~“<l>Despexit.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Respiciet</s>—My eyes shall see my enemies cast down so that, far from fearing them, I shall despise them, and my ears shall hear the chastisement inflicted on those that are risen against me in their malice to plot my ruin.
12~The just shall flourish and shall endure as the palm-tree, which always remains green; they shall grow to a great height, like a cedar of Libanon.
13~Planted in the house of the Lord, and cultivated by him, they shall flourish; that is, they will always preserve their vigor and their beauty.
14~“<l>Uberi.</s>” Abundant in fruits of virtue. “<l>Bene patientes.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Virentes et florentes</s>—Green and flowering; and St. Jerome translates: <l>Frondentes</s>—Leafy. That is: Of a temperament full of strength, they will be well able to bear up against fatigues. “<l>Ut annuntient.</s>” Bellarmine says that this verb should be joined to the following verse.
15~To make known to all the world, by word and example, that the Lord is right and just in all things, and that there is no iniquity or injustice in him because he allows the wicked to prosper; for in his own time, he will reward the just and punish sinners as they deserve.
0~The psalmist exalts the power that God manifested in creating heaven and earth; and transporting himself in thought to the first moment of creation, he represents to himself God, who in some way proceeds from the mystery of his eternal existence, in order to reveal himself in the production of creatures.
1~The Lord has established his kingdom over the whole universe; he has clothed himself with majesty; he has girt himself ready to govern the world and to fill it with his benefits.
3~Lord, thy throne or thy reign was established from all eternity, since Thou hast existed eternally before all creatures.
4,5~The rivers seem to have raised their voice to praise Thee; the sound of many waters has served them for voice to give Thee glory.
6~Marvellous are the heavings of the waves of the sea when agitated by the winds; yet more marvellous is the Lord, who from the height of heaven bridles the rage of the billows, and governs all things.
7~The tokens of Thy goodness and grandeur, which are proclaimed from Thy house, that is, from the Church, are but too clear and evident; it is fitting then that this Thy house should by Thy divine Providence ever be kept holy and pure of all stain.
0~The subject of this psalm is the Providence of God, attentive to the punishing of the wicked and to the rewarding of the just; although, by a judgment full of wisdom, it often happens that the wicked prosper in this world and the just are afflicted. The first fourteen verses of this psalm show us the just who are afflicted and who lament in seeing the prosperity of the wicked. The psalmist rebukes the just for their little faith, and exhorts them to be patient and to put their trust in God.
1~The Lord is the God of vengeance, that is, he that punishes crimes; he punishes them, and there is no one that can prevent him from doing so. In the Hebrew this verse is in the imperative mood, and St. Jerome thus translates it: <l>Deus ultionum, Domine, Deus ultionum ostendere</s>—O Lord, God of vengeance, show the power That thou hast of punishing the wicked.
2~“<l>Exaltare.</s>” That is: Let Thy all-powerful justice be known. St. Augustine here remarks that the prophet, under the imperative form, is simply predicting. He says: <l>Prophetia est prædicentis, non audacia jubentis</s>—The prophecy of one that predicts, not the presumptuousness of one that commands.
5~“<l>Humiliaverunt.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Attriverunt.</s> That is: They have oppressed and tormented this people who are Thy inheritance.
6~That is: They did not hesitate to put to death all those that they found before them: the widows, the orphans, and even strangers whom they did not know.
7~“<l>Nec intelliget Deus Jacob.</s>” According to St. Augustine: <l>Deus nec advertit ut sciat</s>—God does not pay attention to know these things.
9~“<l>Plantavit.</s>” That is: Has formed. “<l>Considerat.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Videbit</s>—Shall he not see?
10~“<l>Corripit.</s>” St. Jerome and St. Augustine translate: <l>Erudit</s>—Instructs. “<l>Qui docet hominem scientiam.</s>” St. Augustine says: <l>Ipse non scit, qui te fecit scire?</s>—Does he not know who made thee know?
11~“<l>Vanæ.</s>” Vain: or, as Mattei prefers, Evil; he says that in the language of the Bible vanity means sin.
12,13~“<l>Ut mitiges ei.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Ut quietem des illi</s>—That Thou mayest give him rest; or, according to St. Jerome’s translation: <l>Ut quiescat</s>—That he may rest. Hence it is thus explained: Happy he whom thou dost instruct, so as to mitigate his pain in the time of tribulation. “<l>Fovea.</s>” The pit of the grave, that is, death; this signifies that the sinner, though he is not afflicted in this life, yet has to die.
14~“<l>Plebem suam, et hereditatem suam.</s>” His people who are faithful to him, and his inheritance which is the same faithful people. (See verse 7.)
15~Different interpretations are given to this verse; but the following appears to me clear: God does not abandon his faithful servants until justice is resolved into judgment, and according to the same justice, all those that are upright in heart shall be judged. This sense seems to me to be that of St. Jerome’s translation, although it is expressed in different terms, namely: <l>Quoniam ad justitiam revertetur judicium, et sequentur illud omnes recti corde</s>—Because judgment shall return to justice, and all the upright in heart shall follow it (that is, judgment).
16~“<l>Consurget mihi ... Stabit mecum.</s>” St. Jerome repeats: <l>Stabit pro me</s>—Will stand up for me.
17~“<l>In inferno.</s>” St. Augustine understands thereby the real hell of the damned; he thus explains: <l>Prope rueram in illam fossam quæ paratur peccatoribus</s>—I was on the point of falling into the pit which is prepared for sinners.
18~“<l>Motus est pes meus.</s>” That is: I am in danger of falling.
20~That is: Wouldst Thou have a throne like that of unjust judges, Thou who feignest or imaginest that Thy precepts are accomplished only with labor and irksomeness? Estius says that here in the Hebrew the word “<l>Laborem,</s>” signifies Affliction. So also Bellarmine, whose explanation seems to be the best.
0~Several corrections were made in this psalm by St. Jerome; but the Church, not having introduced them into the invitatory of the Office, it follows that we recite it in the breviary as it was recited according to the ancient version. St. Paul declares (Heb. 3:7, 4:7) that in this psalm everything directly refers to Jesus Christ; and since we understand this psalm as proclaiming God, the Creator, and at the same time the Saviour of the world, it is to him as to our supreme Pastor that the Holy Ghost exhorts us to address our praises, and to hearken to him.
1~“<l>Præoccupemus faciem ejus in confessione</s>” Before the rising of the sun, let us be found in the presence of the Saviour, to praise him and to confess to him our faults. St. Augustine says: “<l>Est confessio laudantis, confessio gementis.</s>—There is the confession of him who praises, and the confession of him who mourns.”
2~“<l>Omnes deos</s>—All the false gods and all the kings of the earth.” “<l>Altitudines montium</s>—Earthly powers,” according to St. Augustine; that is to say: The Lord regards alike the powerful of the world and the poor whom the world despises; for all are in his power; therefore he does not reject any of his people.
4~“<l>Sicut in exacerbatione...</s>” It must here be remarked that this passage is in the Office, as it was anciently read in the psalm; but it was afterwards corrected, as it is now in the psalter, where we read: “<l>Sicut in irritatione, secundum diem tentationis in deserto, ubi tentaverunt me patres vestri; probaverunt me, et viderunt opera mea.</s>” This version, with which the English translation agrees, better explains the text, of which the sense is as follows: It is God who here speaks to the Hebrews, and he says to them: Harden not your hearts, as you did formerly when you provoked me to anger in the wilderness, where your fathers wished to tempt me, to see whether I was the true God, when in that barren and utterly destitute place they sought for water, bread, and flesh; they found by experience at the sight of my wonderful works that I can do all things according to my own pleasure.
5~“<l>Proximus</s>” Instead of this word, we read in the corrected version, or the psalter, <l>Offensus;</s> and St. Paul says, <l>Infensus</s> (Heb. 3:10). But it is the same thing, as Du Hamel and Bellarmine remark, if <l>Proximus</s> is put for <l>Proximus ad ulciscendum.</s>—“<l>Semper hi errant corde; ipsi vero non cognoverunt vias meas</s>” They have always a perverse heart; they do not wish to know my righteous judgments.—“<l>Requiem meam.</s>” My rest, that is to say, the land that I promised them.
0~We see, according to 1 Paral. 16:7-36, that David composed this psalm when the Ark was transferred from the house of Obededom to the Tabernacle erected on Mount Sion, which is the figure of our holy Church. In this psalm the Jews are exhorted to praise the Lord, and especially are Christians called on to serve Jesus Christ. With St. Jerome, St. Augustine, St. Ambrose, and with the generality of interpreters, Bellarmine says that David in this psalm aimed chiefly at foretelling the coming of the Messias and the establishment of his kingdom.

2~“<l>Salutare ejus.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Salutem ejus;</s> and the Chaldee: <l>Redemptionem ejus.</s> That is: The salvation that he has procured us by Redemption.
5~“<l>Dæmonia.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Dii vani, falsi, nihil</s>—Vain, false gods, nothing.
6~“<l>Confessio et pulchritudo in conspectu ejus.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Gloria et decor coram eo;</s> and Mattei says that in the Bible the word <l>Confessio</s> is taken for the praise that is given to God. “<l>In sanctificatione ejus.</s>” Mattei understands: <l>In ipso Sancto</s>—In him the Holy One by essence. We may also translate these words according to the Hebrew: <l>In sanctuario ejus,</s>—In his Temple, or Tabernacle.
7~“<l>Patriæ gentium.</s>” Estius, according to the Hebrew, says that we should read: <l>Familiæ gentium.</s> So also Menochius, Tirinus, and others, with St. Jerome, who translates: <l>Families populorum.</s>
8~“<l>Hostias.</s>” Bellarmine and Menochius say that the Hebrew word denotes an unbloody offering, and especially one made of flour; this points to the Holy Eucharist. Jansenius of Ghent, Tirinus, Rotigni, Sa, and others, make the same remark.
9~“<l>Commoveatur.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Paveat.</s> “<l>Regnavit.</s>” St. Justin (Dial, cum Tryph.), St. Augustine, and St. Leo read: <l>Regnavit a ligno</s>—Hath reigned from the wood. But the Church no longer uses this version, except in the hymn <l>Vexilla Regis,</s> in which she sings: <l>Regnavit a ligno Deus.</s>
10~“<l>Correxit.</s>” According to the Hebrew and the Chaldee: <l>Firmavit</s>—Has made firm, or established.
11~“<l>Plenitudo ejus.</s>” All that is in the sea, as the islands, the fishes, etc. “<l>Omnia quæ in eis sunt.</s>” All that is found in the fields, as the flocks and herds, the plants, etc.
13~“<l>In æquitate ... In veritate sua.</s>” That is: With an exact judgment as regards the good and the wicked.
0~According to Xavier Mattei, the holy Fathers saw in this psalm the announcement of the first and the second coming of the Redeemer. Hence the psalm is chiefly to be understood in the spiritual sense.
1~That is: Behold, the Lord has come to govern and to judge the world; let them all, the inhabitants of the earth, rejoice.
2~“<l>Correctio.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Firmamentum;</s> which signifies that the firmness of his tribunal will consist in the justice of his judgments.
3~Fire will consume everything on the last day according to what St. Peter says: <l>Terra autem, et quæ in ipsa sunt opera, exurentur</s>—The earth and the works that are in it shall be burnt (2 Peter 3:10).
7~“<l>In simulacris suis.</s>” In the protection of the idols that they invoke.
8~“<l>Audivit, et lætata est Sion.</s>” Sion, the faithful people, the Church, hearing of these things was full of joy, according to the invitation given in verse 1.
9~“<l>Filiæ Judæ.</s>” The same faithful people. “<l>Propter judicia tua.</s>” Knowing that Thou art to judge the world.
10~“<l>Omnes deos.</s>” That is, according to Mattei: All the judges of the earth.
11~“<l>Sanctorum suorum.</s>” Of his servants. “<l>De manu peccatoris.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>De manu impiorum</s>—From the hands of the ungodly.
12~The gift of light is granted to the just man, and that of joy to all those that are right of heart.
13~“<l>Confitemini memoriæ sanctificationis ejus.</s>” Praise him, ever mindful of the gift of sanctification which you have received from him.
0~The prophet thanks God for having delivered his people from captivity; he at the same time foretells in a figurative sense the coming of Jesus Christ and the Redemption of mankind.
1~“<l>Quia mirabilia fecit.</s>” For the marvels that he has wrought in behalf of his servants.
2~This verse may well be applied to Jesus Christ. “<l>Sibi.</s>” Bellarmine says that this word, according to the Hebrew, is to be understood as if it were <l>Ipsa;</s> which gives this meaning: It is his own right hand that has saved the world. But St. Augustine refers the pronoun <l>Sibi</s> to Jesus Christ, as to the end proposed, thus: Christ has saved men for himself, that is, for his own glory. “<l>Et brachium sanctum ejus.</s>” And all has been the work of his own holy arm.
3~“<l>Salutare suum.</s>” The salvation that he has provided for the world. “<l>Revelavit justitiam suam.</s>” He has by means of his apostles manifested his justice, that is, his fidelity in the accomplishment of the promised Redemption.
4~God is said to remember when he fulfils a promise that he has made; now he had promised the people of Israel to come to save mankind; and he remembered his mercy and his fidelity by accomplishing this promise.
7~“<l>Voce psalmi.</s>” That is, as explained by Bellarmine, Menochius, and Lallemant: <l>Sonitu psalterii</s>—With the sound of the psaltery. “<l>Ductilibus.</s>” Menochius thus explains them: <l>Mettalicis, ex laminibus malleo ductis</s>—Long, straight, metal trumpets shaped and attuned by the hammer.
9~“<l>Plaudent manu.</s>” As one does to praise any one. “<l>Judicare.</s>” To govern by excellent laws.
10~“<l>In æquitate.</s>” According to the Hebrew, as Bellarmine remarks: <l>In rectitudine</s>—Rectitude, or righteousness.
0~David invites his people to come to praise and invoke God on the Mount Sion. Now the Mount Sion is a figure of the Catholic Church, in the bosom of which we should invoke and praise Jesus Christ.
1~The Lord has established his reign in spite of the idolatrous nations who are enraged thereat. He has his throne above the Cherubim, however much the earth be thereby troubled; this signifies that no one can resist his power.
3~Let all praise and fear Thy great name; for it is terrible on account of its power and its sanctity, and the honor of a king, that is, his dignity, his authority, requires him to love justice, that is, to exercise righteous judgment by rendering to every one according to his deserts.
4~Thou hast established righteous laws for the direction of the conduct of men, as Thou hast shown in the midst of the people of Israel, exercising justice and judgment, that is, judging always according to judgment.
5~“<l>Scabellum pedum ejus.</s>” They invoked the Lord before the holy Ark. “<l>In columna nubis.</s>” According to St. Augustine, by the column of fire we must understand the obscure language that the Lord used.
8~“<l>Testimonia ejus.</s>” That is, according to Bellarmine: All the precepts given in common to all. “<l>Præceptum quod dedit illis.</s>” The special precept that he had given them, namely, to govern and to instruct the people.
9~“<l>Propitius fuisti eis, et ulciscens in omnes adinventiones eorum.</s>” St. Augustine and Menochius give this explanation: Thou wast propitious to them in pardoning the people for their sake, but without letting go unpunished the injuries and the calumnies that they had to suffer from this people. Bellarmine says that these two interpretations are probable.
10~“<l>Sanctus Dominus Deus.</s>” God is holy by essence, and consequently worthy of every homage.
0~The royal prophet exhorts the faithful to praise God and to thank him first for having created us; then for having given us for our mother this holy Church which nourishes her children as young and tender sheep.
1~All ye people of the earth, let all your joy be to praise your God, and to serve him as is meet.
3~Have always before the eyes of your mind that the Lord is the true God; we did not of ourselves come into the world, nor did we make ourselves; it is he that gave us being.
4~“<l>Introite portas ejus in confessione.</s>” Enter, therefore, the gates of his tabernacle, by confessing yourselves unworthy to stand in his presence. “<l>Confitemini illi.</s>” Acknowledge that all that you have has come from his beneficent hand.
5~“<l>Veritas ejus.</s>” The truth of his teachings and of his promises.
0~David here gives excellent instructions to those that govern, and particularly to princes how they should live well. Also, every father of a family will find in this psalm rules for his conduct.
2~“<l>Psallam.</s>” I will sing Thy praises upon the psaltery. “<l>Intelligam in via immaculata.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In via perfecta.</s> I will apply myself to know and to follow the pure and perfect way. “<l>Quando venies ad me?</s>” But when wilt Thou come to my help?
3~“<l>Perambulabam.</s>” Some explain this and the following verse in the past tense, as they are in the Vulgate and in the Greek; but the Hebrew has them in the future, and thus St. Jerome translates: <l>Ambulabo</s>—I will walk. “<l>Domus meæ.</s>” That is, of those belonging to my house.
4~That is, with the verbs in the future tense: I will never propose to do anything unjust; I will hate, or I hold in abomination, all the transgressors of Thy law.
5~“<l>Non adhæsit mihi cor pravum.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Cor pravum recedet a me.</s> Explanation of this verse: I will never associate with those who have their heart perverse; and if any one of those wicked persons keeps away from me, that is, does not wish to have me for a friend by changing his conduct, I will not know him, that is, I will show that I do not wish to know him.
6~That is: For him who secretly rends the character of his neighbor, I will keep him at a distance, or I will ever persecute him by reproaching him with his vice.
7~I will never sit at table with those who have a proud eye, that is, who look upon others with contempt; nor with the insatiable of heart, that is, with the ambitious and avaricious.
8~My eyes shall be attentive to choose for my companions faithful men who live with me on this earth, and I will not have myself served or aided in my needs except by those that live apart from vice.
9~The proud man shall not live in my house, and he that speaks unjustly, by lies or detraction, shall not remain long before my eyes, that is, I will drive him from my presence. “<l>Non dixerit.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Non firmabitur</s>—shall not be established.
10~I will hasten to exterminate all the wicked from the country, taking care that they are punished; thus I shall banish from the city of the Lord all those that lead bad lives, and who seek to have companions in evil.
0~In this psalm, which is one of the seven penitential psalms, we see one humbling himself before God, praying for himself and for all the people. According to St. Augustine, it is Jesus Christ who prays for us; in fact, it cannot be denied that in certain verses the Messias and his coming are spoken of.
4~“<l>Cremium.</s>” Du Hamel says: <l>Cremium est id omne quod facile crematur</s>—Whatever easily burns.
5~Interpretation: My heart has been stricken as grass by Thy hand, and my spirit has remained in aridity so that I have forgotten to take my food.
7~“<l>Pelicano.</s>” The pelican loves solitude. According to Mattei, this bird is said to exist, but in reality no one has any knowledge of it. “<l>Nycticorax.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Bubo</s>—the owl which makes its dwelling in ruins and deserted places. “<l>Domicilio.</s>” Mariana says: <l>Vox hebræa ruinas vel parrietinas significant</s>—The Hebrew word signifies ruins or crumbling walls.
8~I have passed whole nights without sleep under the pressure of my woes, and I am become like a solitary sparrow which complains upon the roof, that is, sadness keeps me to within the most retired parts of my house.
9~“<l>Jurabant.</s>” According to Du Hamel: <l>Conjurabant</s>—Conspired together.
10~“<l>Cinerem tamquam panem manducabam.</s>” The bread that I ate seemed to me insipid as ashes.
11~“<l>Elevans allisisti me.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Levasti me, et allisisti me.</s>
13~“<l>In æternum permanes.</s>” That is: Thou art, and Thou wilt always be the same. “<l>Memoriale tuum.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Memoria tua.</s> Mattei says that the Hebrew may be so translated; and Menochius explains it thus: <l>Tui memoria, et mentio, et laus</s>—The memory, the mention, and the praise of Thee.
14~“<l>Exsurgens.</s>” That is: As if rising from a profound sleep. “<l>Tempus.</s>” The time fixed in Thy decrees.
15~Mariana says that here is meant the city of Jerusalem, when it was destroyed by its enemies. “<l>Lapides ejus.</s>” The heaps of stones, which is all that is left of the city. “<l>Terræ ejus.</s>” The Hebrew, according to Menochius, Bossuet, and Mattei, here signifies <l>Pulveris ejus</s>—The dust of its ruins.
16~“<l>Gloriam tuam.</s>” That is: They shall know and fear Thy power.
17~Thus it shall happen when God shall build up Sion; and he shall be seen in his glory, that is, in his temple, according to Maldonatus, Mariana, and Mattei.
19~“<l>Populus qui creabitur.</s>” Mattei says that this is to be understood of Christians, who, regenerated by baptism, are called by St. Paul: <l>Nova creatura</s>—New creature (Gal. 6:15).
21~“<l>Filios interemptorum.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Filios mortis.</s> Mattei observes that these two versions according to the Hebrew expression signify the same thing, namely: Those doomed to death; that is, men deprived of the grace before the Redemption.
23~“<l>In unum.</s>” In one church, in one same faith. Du Hamel thus comments: <l>Hæc ad Ecclesiam sub Christo referuntur.</s> Bellarmine, Malvenda, Mariana, and Menochius say the same.
24~Bellarmine and Mattei say that this verse is very obscure, as indeed it is. “<l>Respondit ei.</s>” Bellarmine thinks that it is the psalmist who answers God in regard to what the Lord ordained in verse 19. “<l>In via virtutis suæ.</s>” That is: In the time of the vigor of his age. “<l>Paucitatem dierum meorum nuntia mihi.</s>” O Lord, make me know the shortness of my days, that is, according to the interpreters, if my life shall be too short for me to see the end of these evils on the day of man’s redemption.
25~“<l>Ne revoces me.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Ne rapias me:</s> For mercy’s sake, do not withdraw me from the world. “<l>In generationem et generationem anni tui.</s>” Thou whose years are eternal, canst add to the number of my years.
26~St. Paul applies to Jesus Christ this verse and the two following verses (Heb. 1:10).
27~“<l>Permanes.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Stabis:</s> Thou shalt ever remain the same. “<l>Veterascent.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Atterentur</s>—They shall come to an end, as a garment worn out by long use.
28~“<l>Opertorium.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Pallium,</s> a cloak. Mattei here admires the images of the Oriental poetry.
29~“<l>Habitabunt.</s>” Shall dwell there, that is, in the holy city. “<l>Semen eorum in sæculum dirigetur.</s>” That is: Thou wilt ever have a care of their posterity.
0~The psalmist extols the divine mercy; but finding himself incapable of praising and thanking God as his benefits deserve, he invites the angels and all creatures to do so in his name.
1~“<l>Omnia quæ intra me sunt.</s>” All my powers.
3~“<l>Propitiatur omnibus iniquitatibus tuis.</s>” He is propitious, that is, he pardons all thy sins. Thus nearly all interpret. “<l>Omnes infirmitates tuas.</s>” That is, as Mattei observes: All thy infirmities, corporal and spiritual.
4~“<l>De interitu.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>De corruptione:</s> and according to the Chaldee: <l>De gehenna:</s> That is: He delivers thy corporal life from the death of the body, and thy spiritual life from the death of the soul, whether it be from sin, or as we may also understand, from hell. “<l>Coronat te.</s>” According to Estius and others: He surrounds them on all sides.
5~“<l>Renovabitur ut aquilæ juventus tua.</s>” He will make thy youth renewed, as the wings and the strength of the eagle are renewed. This may be understood, as Mattei says, of the renewal of the soul by baptism, and conversion to penance, according to the words of St. Paul: <l>Exspoliantes vos veterem hominem, cum actibus suis, et induentes novum, eum qui renovatur. ...</s> Stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds, and putting on the new, him who is renewed ... (Col. 3:9,10).
7~“<l>Vias suas.</s>” That is: The dispositions of his Providence.
8~God is compassionate and merciful, and he will manifest to us the effects of his mercy. “<l>Longanimis.</s>” He is slow to punish, he is patient, but only up to a certain point.
9~If he is angry with any one, and if he threatens to abandon him, his menaces will not last always if the sinner amends his life.
10~Ah! let us never cease to thank him, knowing that he has not treated us as our sins deserve, and that he has not punished us according to our wickedness.
13~“<l>Figmentum nostrum.</s>” That is: Our weakness.
14~He knows that we are only dust, and that man, living on this earth, is like the grass, which to-day flowers in the field and to-morrow withers and dies.
15~“<l>Spiritus pertransibit in illo, et non subsistet.</s>” In this life the spirit is not in man; but is passing on its way to eternity. “<l>Non cognoscet amplius locum suum.</s>” That is: He does not return to know his place any more, that is, to begin over again his past years.
17~“<l>Justitia illius.</s>” His beneficent justice. “<l>Testamentum ejus.</s>” His covenant, or his law.
19~“<l>Regnum ipsius omnibus dominabitur.</s>” That is: All will have to obey his rule.
0~According to the interpreters, this psalm presents a brilliant description of the glory of the Saviour as manifested in the works of nature. In it we find a eulogy of the wisdom and of the power that God has, shown forth in creating heaven and earth. The author of the arguments, placed at the head of the psalms in the Compilation of Venice, adds that we learn here how to see nature and the manifold variety of created things.
1~“<l>Vehementer.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Nimis:</s> Beyond all measure, exceedingly. That is: Thou hast made Thy greatness known by Thy works in a wonderful manner.
2~“<l>Confessionem.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Gloriam</s>—Glory.
3~“<l>Pellem.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Tentorium.</s> “<l>Aquis.</s>” Estius understands by this the clouds. According to Mattei, this part of the heavens is really covered with waters.
4~Thou ridest upon a cloud, as upon a chariot which goes whither Thou willest; Thou walkest flying on the winds as if they were birds that had their wings extended.
5~Thou makest the celestial spirits who are always before Thy throne Thy angels; and of these same spirits who burn with the fire of Thy love Thou makest messengers, to execute Thy orders with promptitude and efficacy. Thus St. Augustine interprets this verse; so also St. Gregory (In Evang. hom. 54); and this agrees with the absolute application that St. Paul makes of it to the angels.
6~“<l>Stabilitatem suam.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Bases suas.</s> That is, as Lallemant well explains: Thou hast made it firm by its own weight; so that, as Mattei adds, it supports itself.
7~“<l>Abyssus.</s>” Mattei says that this word in the language of the Bible signifies an accumulation of waters. “<l>Stabunt.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Stabant.</s> The sense of the verse is: There was a time when Thou didst cover the earth with waters in such a manner that these waters were higher than the mountains (Gen. 7:20).
8~Then at the sound of Thy voice, that is, of Thy command, as at the roar of threatening thunder, these waters withdrew, as if seized with terror in the place assigned to them, which was the sea.
9~At this command it seems that the mountains rose up and the plains descended to the place which Thou didst destine for them.
12~“<l>Onagri.</s>” Wild asses, by which may be understood all wild animals.
13~“<l>Super ea.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Juxta eos.</s> Above or beside these fountains or these springs of water. “<l>De medio petrarum.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Inter ramos;</s> or according to St. Jerome’s translation: <l>De medio nemorum</s>—In the midst of the neighboring groves.
14~Thou waterest the mountains with the upper waters, which descend from the clouds; thus the earth by Thy Providence shall be satisfied, and shall abound in fruit.
16~“<l>Vinum lætificet cor hominis.</s>” Here St. John Chrysostom makes this reflection: “Some say: Let there be no wine; but we should rather say: Let there be no drunkenness; for wine is the work of God, but drunkenness the work of the devil” (Ad pop. Ant. Hom. 1).
17~We should here remark, that according to Theodoret, Maldonatus, Menochius, Tirinus, and others, the Orientals used to anoint the face with oil to show a cheerful countenance. The sense then is: Thou producest the olives, the oil of which serves to anoint the countenance to make it look joyous, and grain to make bread wherewith to sustain the life of man.
18~“<l>Saturabuntur.</s>” Shall be sated with these waters of fountains and of rains. “<l>Ligna campi.</s>” Mattei hereby understands wild plants. “<l>Passeres.</s>” The sparrows and the other birds.
19~“<l>Herodii.</s>” It is uncertain what kind of bird this name denotes: according to St. Jerome, it is the kite; but Estius, Lallemant, and others, following the Chaldee, say that it is the stork. “<l>Herodii domus dux est eorum.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Herodii abies est domus ejus.</s> That is: The top of the fir-tree is her house. “<l>Herinaciis.</s>” According to the Greek, <l>Leporibus</s>—For the rabbits. See Mattei.
20~“<l>Fecit lunam in tempore.</s>” The Hebrews used to regulate their calendar by the moon: <l>A luna signum diei festi</s>—From the moon is the sign of the festival day (Ecclus. 63:7). “<l>Sol cognovit occasum suum.</s>” The sun runs its course to its setting; or as Malvenda explains the verse, the sun knows how to go through its course without the variations incident to the moon.
22~The lions come forth roaring with their cubs to seek for prey in the forests; and by their roaring they seem to ask of God their food.
25~“<l>Possessione tua.</s>” According to the Greek: <l>Creatura tua</s>—With Thy creatures. Menochius and Mattei explain thus: The earth is filled with the goods that Thou hast created.
26~“<l>Reptilia.</s>” Properly: Reptiles, animals without legs, that crawl on their bellies. Here the word signifies every kind of fish.
28~“<l>Draco.</s>” St. Jerome writes: <l>Leviathan.</s> Others, as Lallemant, and perhaps all, commonly say that it is the whale; but according to Mattei this is not certain; it is only certain that some sea-monster is signified. “<l>Ad illudendum ei.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Ut luderet in eo.</s> Thus it is understood by Maldonatus, Estius, Sa, Malvenda, Mattei, etc.
30~That is: If Thou withdraw Thy gracious looks, they will languish; Thou wilt take away their life and they will cease to be; they return to the dust whence Thou didst draw them.
31~That is: Thou wilt send forth the breath of life into other animals, to which Thou wilt give being, and thus Thou wilt renew the face of the earth. Du Hamel applies this in a mystical sense to the Holy Ghost, who by his grace renews the face of the earth, that is, of the souls living in this world; and thus the Church uses this verse in her Liturgy at Pentecost.
32~That is: Let then the Lord be glorified forever! and let us act in such a manner that he may rejoice in us, who are his works, and that he may not be saddened by our faults.
33~That is: Let us beware of provoking this powerful Lord, who with a single glance makes the earth tremble, and who by touching the mountains causes them to smoke with his thunder and lightning, as he did on Mount Sinai: <l>Totus autem mons Sinai fumabat</s>—And all Mount Sinai was in a smoke (Exod. 19:18).
0~The prophet urges the Jews to praise God, and to thank him for all the benefits bestowed on their fathers.
3~“<l>Laudamini in nomine sancto ejus.</s>” That is: Render yourselves worthy of praise by your zeal in procuring glory to his holy name.
4~Be constant in seeking God; try to be in spirit always in his presence.
5~“<l>Judicia oris ejus.</s>” His commandments, or his law.
6~I say this to you who are the posterity of Abraham, and the servants of the Lord; to you, children of Jacob, who are the chosen people of God.
7~“<l>In universa terra judicia ejus.</s>” That is: He governs the whole earth.
8~He has always been mindful of his covenant with his servants, and of the promise that he made them in words that expressed his will, to make all subsequent generations have part therein.
10~“<l>Præceptum.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Statutum, Decretum.</s> “<l>Testamentum æternum.</s>” A covenant or compact that was always to be observed.
11~“<l>Terram Chanaan.</s>” The Land of Promise, where the Chanaanites dwelt. “<l>Funiculum hereditatis vestræ.</s>” This land will be possessed by your children as an inheritance distributed with a line of cord.
12~“<l>Incolæ.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Peregrini, Advenæ.</s>
13~The patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had to pass from one country to another, as from Palestine to Egypt (Gen. 12, 20, 26, 28, 31, 36).
15~“<l>Christos meos ... Prophetis meis.</s>” My anointed ... my prophets; that is, the patriarchs.
16~“<l>Firmamentum panis.</s>” That is: The support of human life, which consists in bread.
17~He ordained that Joseph, who had been sold by his brethren, should be taken before them into Egypt, and thus deliver them from famine (Gen. 37:28).
18~“<l>Ferrum per transiit animam ejus.</s>” According to the Greek: <l>Anima,</s> instead of “<l>Animam.</s>” The Hebrew may be understood either way; but Bellarmine says that in the Vulgate the sense is clearer, and that thus St. Jerome, St. Augustine, and others explain the passage; namely: The pain caused by the iron fetters afflicted the soul of Joseph. “<l>Donec veniret verbum ejus.</s>” That is: Until the accomplishment of his prophecy concerning the release from prison of Pharao’s chief butler, which release was followed by his own (Gen. 40:12, 41:9).
19~The spirit of prophecy with which Joseph felt himself inspired was as a torch which inflamed him; that is, which encouraged him to make this prediction. Then king Pharao, this prince of many peoples, set him at liberty.
20~“<l>Principem omnis possessionis suæ.</s>” Chief of his whole kingdom.
21~“<l>Principes ejus.</s>” The great men of his court, of his possessions. “<l>Senex ejus.</s>” The ancients of his council.
22~“<l>Israel ... Jacob.</s>” Jacob with his family. “<l>Terra Cham.</s>” Egypt. We have already said (see Psalm 77:56) that this country was peopled by the descendants of Cham, son of Noe; it was Mesraim, son of Cham, who first established himself in Egypt.
24~That is: By multiplying the Israelites, God gave occasion to the Egyptians to be exasperated against his faithful people, to seek every means of oppressing his servants (Exod. 1).
25~Then the Lord sent his servant Moses, and Aaron his brother whom he chose to be his fellow-helper. “<l>Ipsum.</s>” Bellarmine observes that the Hebrew may be rendered by <l>Ei;</s> but he says, with St. Augustine, that among the Hebrews the word <l>Ipsum</s> is used simply for elegance, and therefore adds nothing to the sense.
26~“<l>Verba signorum.</s>” A Hebraism, which means: The power to work miracles.
27~In this verse, and in the eight following verses, David describes the miraculous prodigies wrought to punish the Egyptians. “<l>Misit tenebras.</s>” This darkness lasted three days (Exod. 10:22). “<l>Non exacerbavit sermones suos.</s>” Some would omit the particle <l>Non;</s> but according to Bellarmine this correction is admissible; for the Vulgate here agrees with the Hebrew text, of which the rendering is: <l>Non exacerbaverunt sermones ejus.</s> That is: Moses and Aaron did not resist the orders of God, who had commanded them to work those wonders.
38~“<l>Expandit nubem in protectionem eorum.</s>” The Lord spread a cloud above the waters to protect them from the heat of the day. But here we must remark with Bellarmine that this cloud is not the pillar spoken of in Exodus: <l>Dominus autem præcedebat eos, ad ostendendam viam, per diem in columnam nubis</s>—And the Lord went before them to show the way by day in a pillar of cloud (Exod. 13:21). The pillar was to go before them to show them the way, and not to be spread out over their heads; moreover, the cloud spread out above them could not take the shape of a pillar. Hence, adds Bellarmine, we are justified in saying that besides the pillar of cloud which went before the Israelites, and which once we read went behind them to protect them against the Egyptians (Exod. 14:19), there was another cloud spread out over them to shelter them from the heat during their journey. This explanation is supported by the Hebrew text, which St. Jerome thus renders: <l>Expandit nubem in tentorium</s>—He spread out a cloud for a tent or covering; as well as by the following words in the Book of Wisdom: <l>Fuit illis in velamento diei, et in luce stellarum per noctem</s>—She was to them for a covert by day, and for the light of stars by night (Wisd. 10:17).
39~The Israelites asked for means to feed on flesh and bread; the Lord sent among them an abundance of quails, and he satiated them with manna, which he caused to fall from heaven.
40~They were thirsty, and the Lord by the hand of Moses broke a rock, whence ran waters seen flowing as torrents in that arid place (Num. 20:11).
43~“<l>Labores populorum possederunt.</s>” They came into possession of the labors of those nations, that is, of the cities which they had built, and of the fields which they had cultivated.
0~The psalmist exhorts the Israelites to thank the Lord for all the wonders wrought in their behalf from the time that they left Egypt till the time of the Judges, and reproaches them for their ingratitude to the Lord. A matter of confusion for us Christians, who have received from God far greater benefits.
1~“<l>In sæculum.</s>” St. Jerome translates: “<l>In æternum.</s>”
2~“<l>Loquetur.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Eloqui poterit.</s> That is: Who shall show forth...?
3~“<l>Judicium.</s>” Judgment, equity, or the law of God.
4,5~In the Hebrew, according to St. Jerome and the other interpreters, instead of the plural, “<l>Nostri,</s>” etc., is found the singular, namely: <l>Mei, Me, Videam, Læter.</s> “<l>In beneplacito populi tui.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>In repropitiatione populi tui.</s> That is: According to the goodness which Thou hast so often shown towards Thy people. “<l>In salutari tuo.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In salute tua;</s> and according to the Chaldee: <l>In redemptione tua.</s> That is: By sending us salvation, or redemption through Jesus Christ, as St. Augustine explains: <l>Ipse est enim Salvator ...; de illo quippe dixit Simeon senex: Quia viderunt oculi mei salutare tuum</s>—Because my eyes have seen Thy salvation. “<l>Ad videndum in bonitate.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Ut videam bonum;</s> or, according to St. Jerome, <l>bona</s>—In order that I may see the good things prepared for Thy elect. “<l>Ad lætandum in lætitia gentis tuæ.</s>” That is, according to the Hebrew: That I may rejoice in the joy, or that I may have part in the joy, of Thy faithful people. “<l>Ut lauderis cum hereditate tua.</s>” That is: That Thou mayest be forever praised in the midst of this people who are Thy inheritance, or Thy domain, chosen for all eternity.
7~That is: They did not appreciate the wonders wrought by Thee for their deliverance, and too soon they forgot Thy many mercies towards them.
8~“<l>Ascendentes in mare.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Juxta mare.</s> That is: They provoked Thy anger near the Red Sea, where they received so many benefits (Exod. 14).
10~Here the prophet returns to speak of the benefits done them in their progress through the Red Sea. “<l>Increpuit Mare Rubrum.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Comminatus est Mari Rubro.</s> God threatened the Red Sea to make it obey; that is, he bade the Red Sea to dry up, its waters withdrawing on both sides to make a way for the Israelites.
13~They then chanted the Canticle of Moses (Exod. 15).
14~“<l>Fecerunt.</s>” They made a change. “<l>Obliti sunt operum ejus.</s>” They forgot all the wonders that God had wrought in their favor. “<l>Non sustinuerunt consilium ejus.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Non expectaverunt voluntatem ejus</s>—They would not wait for the execution of his will.
15~“<l>In inaquosa.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>In solitudine.</s>
16~“<l>Misit saturitatem in animas eorum.</s>” That is: God sent them to satiety the food that they craved.
17~“<l>Irritaverunt.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Inviderunt;</s> and the Chaldee: <l>Invidia commoti sunt.</s> Reference is here made to the envy that Dathan and Abiron, named in the following verse, had conceived against Moses and Aaron on seeing them constituted leaders of the people, envy that led them to address to Moses and Aaron these words: <l>Cur elevamini super populum Domini?</s>—Why lift you up yourselves above the people of the Lord? (Num. 16:3.) “<l>Sanctum Domini.</s>” Aaron, consecrated to God as his priest.
18~The earth swallowed them both up, with all those that had joined their party of revolt (Num. 16:32).
19~“<l>Synagoga eorum.</s>” The multitude of those that murmured the following day (Num. 16:41).
20~The psalmist refers here to another rising of the Israelites, when they worshipped the golden calf (Exod. 32). “<l>In Horeb.</s>” near Mount Horeb, or Sinai.
21~“<l>Gloriam suam.</s>” Some understand these words to mean the glory of the Israelites; but according to the Chaldee we read: <l>Gloriam Domini sui;</s> and Estius says the sense of the verse is: They gave to the image of a calf the glory that is due to God.
23~That is: God then declared that he would destroy his people (Exod. 22:10), and so he would have done if Moses, whom he had chosen to be their leader, had not interposed in his presence as their mediator. “<l>In confractione.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In ruptura,</s> or <l>divisione;</s> and St. Jerome translates: <l>Medius (stetisset medius contra faciem illius).</s>
24~“<l>Terram desiderabilem.</s>” The land that God had promised them, and that was so worthy of their desires.
26,27~“<l>Manum suam.</s>” His hand armed with the sword of justice. Bellarmine here remarks that the first of these chastisements was inflicted in the desert itself, where all the murmurers twenty years old and upwards were condemned to die (Num. 14:29); the second, namely, the dispersion, had its accomplishment later on, at first by means of the king of Babylon, and more fully afterwards by Titus and Vespasian.
28~Here David mentions another sin of the Israelites which they committed when, led away by the daughters of Moab, they began to worship their idol Beelphegor (Num. 25). Don Calmet, in a dissertation at the beginning of the Book of Numbers, shows that Beelphegor is the same as Adonis. “<l>Sacrificia mortuorum.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Victimas mortuorum.</s> That is: Sacrifices offered to dead gods, such as are the gods of the Gentiles; while our true God is a living God.
29~“<l>In adinventionibus suis.</s>” With their perverse inventions, that is, with their superstitions. “<l>Multiplicata est in eis ruina.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Erupit in eos plaga.</s> That is: A great slaughter was made of them on account of this sacrilege; the number of those that perished on this occasion amounted to twenty-four thousand (Num. 25:9).
30~Phinees, grandson of Aaron, burning with zeal for God, slew one of the transgressors of the law, with his accomplice. “<l>Stetit.</s>” He stood firm for the honor of the law. “<l>Placavit.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Dijudicavit</s>—He judged and punished the guilty one. Others, according to the Chaldee: <l>Oravit;</s> or <l>Oratione placavit</s> He interposed by praying for his people, and appeased the anger of God. “<l>Cessavit quassatio.</s>” That is, according to some interpreters: The disorder ceased. But the sense of the Chaldee is: <l>Cessavit mors;</s> and St. Jerome translates in the same sense: <l>Est retenta percussio</s>—The slaughter ceased. This last interpretation is the best; for we read in Numbers: <l>Cessavitque plaga a filiis Israel</s>—And the scourge ceased from the children of Israel (Num. 25:8).
31~This act of Phinees was ascribed to him for merit, as a work of justice and of true zeal. He received in recompense the dignity of high-priest (Num. 25:13), which continued in his family for more than thirteen centuries, according to Mattei, with Mariana, Menochius, etc. “<l>In sempiternum.</s>” That is: He received this reward for as long as the Mosaic law should last; <l>Quamdiu lex duraret,</s> says Emmanuel Sa.
32~The Israelites committed another sin (Num. 20) when, suffering from want of water in the desert, they broke out in unjust murmurings. Moses then, though he had received from God the command to speak to the rock, hesitated somewhat, having conceived a certain feeling of diffidence; however, he struck the rock and water flowed from it in great abundance. God, displeased with Moses on account of his hesitation, punished him by making him die before entering the Promised Land. “<l>Ad aquas contradictionis.</s>” That is: In the place where on account of the want of water there arose a contradiction and a contest against Moses. “<l>Exacerbaverunt spiritum ejus.</s>” They so embittered his soul that he hesitated to execute the order that God had given him to speak to the rock.
33~God with his own mouth rebuked the Hebrews, reproving them for not having exterminated the Gentiles, as he had commanded them.
37~“<l>Fornicati sunt.</s>” In the Bible apostasy from the faith is called Fornication, or treason like to that of unfaithful spouses, who are false to their plighted troth. “<l>In adinventionibus suis.</s>” That is: With their superstitions.
38~“<l>Hereditatem suam.</s>” Those whom he had chosen for his own people.
41~“<l>In consilio suo.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In consilio ipsorum</s>—By the purpose, as Menochius explains, which they formed of serving idols. “<l>Humiliate sunt in iniquitatibus suis.</s>” According to Mattei we are by this not to understand that they were humbled in their wickedness, but that they grew more wicked in their humiliations.
42~However, the Lord, seeing them thus afflicted, had pity on them and lent his ear to their prayers.
43~“<l>Testamenti sui.</s>” That is, of the promises made to their fathers. “<l>Pœnituit eum.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Conversus est ab ira sua.</s> He turned aside from his anger, as though he felt sorrow for having punished them.
44~That is, according to Maldonatus, Mariana, Tirinus, and Mattei: He caused them to meet with compassion from their enemies, who held them captives.
45~“<l>Congrega nos de nationibus.</s>” Gather us together by delivering us from the midst of the Gentiles, where we are scattered.
46~That is: In order that we may come to render Thee thanks in celebrating ...
47~Then we shall sing: Blessed be, etc.
0~In the literal sense this psalm sets forth the sufferings that the Jews endured in their captivity and in the desert, and it exhorts them to return thanks to God for having delivered them therefrom. In the figurative sense it represents the miseries from which Jesus Christ has delivered Christians. In it, moreover, the prophet clearly announces the ruin of the Synagogue, the vocation of the Gentiles, and the establishment of the Church.
3~From the East and from the West, from the North and from the South.
4~“<l>Erraverunt.</s>” The Israelites wandered, etc.
9~He provided in the desert a marvellous food, and he satisfied those that were famishing.
10~He assisted them when they were in dark prisons, which were as the shadow of death; in want of everything and bound with iron chains.
12~Then was their heart humbled by labors, that is, the pride of their heart was brought low by the hardships that they suffered in the midst of all their afflictions. They grew too weak to resist their enemies, and there was no one to help them to deliver themselves from their hands.
14~“<l>De tenebris et umbra mortis.</s>” See verse 10.
16~That is, he has delivered them from prison or from captivity.
18~By reason of their infirmity or sickness.
19~In repeating this verse several times, the prophet wishes to make us understand the compassion that God has for our miseries, and at the same time the efficacy of prayer which makes the Lord not know how to refuse help to him who asks it of him.
20~“<l>Verbum suum.</s>” His word, or his orders.
25~“<l>Dixit.</s>” God commanded. “<l>Stetit spiritus procellæ.</s>” The wind that makes the storm went forth immediately.
26~The waves of the sea mount and then sink again; the mariners are troubled by fear and their strength begins to fail.
27~“<l>Omnis sapientia eorum devorata est.</s>” In the midst of their confusion they have lost all their seaman’s craft.
30~“<l>Deduxit eos.</s>” The Lord has conducted them.
32~“<l>Seniorum.</s>” The ancients, or the chiefs of the people.
33~“<l>Posuit.</s>” The Lord has wrought these other wonders; he has, etc.
39~Afterwards, in punishment for their sins, they were reduced, etc.
40~Contempt was also cast upon their princes, that is, the Lord made the chiefs who ruled them to be despised by allowing them to fall into many mistakes, when they strayed from the path of justice and prudence.
42~The just shall see these mercies and rejoice thereat; while the wicked for shame of their iniquity shall not dare to open their mouth.
43~He that is wise will remember these things; and while meditating on them will understand how far reach the mercies of the Lord.
0~David consecrates this chant to giving thanks to God for his benefits, and to praying to him for victory over the Edomites. It must be remarked that this psalm has already been explained, partly: verses 1-5, in Psalm 61:10-14; and for the rest, in Psalm 59:5-13. We shall content ourselves with giving here a succinct explanation.
1~My heart is disposed to write whatever Thou ordainest; in all I will bless Thee, and I will sing Thy praises.
2~“<l>Gloria mea.</s>” My spirit, which loves to praise God. “<l>Exurgam diluculo.</s>” I wish to praise Thee at early morn.
4~I shall say that for all, from earth even to the heavens, is full of Thy mercy and fidelity.
5~“<l>Ut liberentur ...</s>” Psalm 59:5.
6,7~Hear me, O Lord, and let Thy right hand save me. God has declared from his sanctuary that I shall one day have the joy of dividing the country of Sichem, or Samaria, and of measuring the lands of the valley of Tents beyond the Jordan, to distribute them at my will.
8~The names of Galaad, Manasses, and Ephraim designate the provinces occupied by the tribes of Israel, whom David called the strength of his head or crown.
9~It is in the tribe of Juda that my throne is established; and the land of Moab which is abundant, makes me hope fully to satisfy my people.
10~“<l>Alienigenæ.</s>” Strangers.
11~Who will lead me into Edom, to take possession of this country, the capital of which is very strong?
12~Shall it not be Thou, my God, who at first didst repel us? Wilt not Thou Thyself go forth with our troops to give us victory?
13~“<l>Vana salus hominis.</s>” In vain can we hope for help from others.
14~Placing our hopes in God, we shall obtain the victory; he will exterminate our enemies.
0~Interpreters have given various explanations of this psalm. Some apply it to Saul giving vent to his anger against Doeg and those that resemble him. Others to David predicting in form of imprecation the chastisements reserved for Doeg and Achitophel, his enemies. Others, as Xavier Mattei, Mark Marius, and Louis Mingarella suppose that the imprecations are uttered against David and Jesus Christ by their enemies. But commonly the Fathers and the other interpreters regard these imprecations as pronounced against Judas and the other enemies of our Lord. This interpretation, which we follow, agrees especially with that of St. Augustine.
1~Hide not my praise, that is, make known my innocence; for the mouth of an impious man and traitor is opened against me. “<l>Super me.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Contra me.</s> St. Augustine explains : <l>Odium, quod dolo tegebatur, erupit in vocem</s>—The hatred, treacherously concealed, broke forth in words.
3~“<l>Detrahebant.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Adversabantur</s>—They contradicted me. “<l>Orabam.</s>” St. Augustine adds: <l>Pro eis ipsis</s>—At the same time I prayed for these very men.
5~St. Augustine applies this verse to Judas, and by the sinner he understands Satan himself, which he thus explains: <l>Diabolo subditus sit, qui Christo subditus esse noluit</s>—Let him be subject to the devil, who refused to be subject to Christ. And in fact Judas was possessed by Satan : <l>Post buccellam, introivit in eum Satanas</s>—After the morsel (that is, after Holy Communion) Satan entered in him (John 13:27).
6~“<l>Cum judicatur</s>” When he shall be judged at the tribunal of God. “<l>Oratio ejus fiat in peccatum</s>” That is, as Lallemant very well explains : If he dares speak in self-defence, may it be ascribed to him as a new crime on account of his temerity.
7~“<l>Episcopatum ejus.</s>” Some understand by this his place of honor or administration; but it may be justly remarked that by the word Episcopate we must understand the apostolate, as St. Peter interprets it in applying this passage to Judas in the assembly of the apostles, who afterwards addressed this prayer to the Lord: <l>Ostende quem elegeris ex his duobus unum, accipere locum ministerii hujus, et apostolatus, de quo prævaricatus est Judas</s>—Show which of these two Thou hast chosen, to take the place of his ministry and apostleship, from which Judas hath by transgression fallen (Acts 1:20-24).
8~Here we must remark, that St. John Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Euthymius are of opinion that Judas was never married. Moreover, Genebrardus and Tirinus think that these imprecations against Judas did not all have their effect in his person, but those only that could reach him. On the other hand, St. Augustine teaches that they were verified with regard to the Jewish people, of whom Judas is here the figure: for by the destruction of Jerusalem the Synagogue became a widow, and the Jews, her children, were made orphans.
9~This happened after the destruction of Jerusalem. “<l>Nutantes transferantur.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Justabiles vagentur.</s>
10~Here Menochius remarks: <l>In excidio Hierosolymitano, adeo Judæorum divitias scrutabantur milites Romani, ut etiam, corporibus sectis aliquorum, viscera scrutati sint, sperantes se aurum, quod deglutivissent, inventuros. Testis Josephus</s>—In the destruction of Jerusalem the Roman soldiers made such a close search after the riches and property of the Jews, that they even ripped up the bodies of some and searched their bowels to find gold which they might have swallowed, as Josephus testifies (De Bello Judaico, l. 6, c. 15).
12~That is, as Lallemant explains: May death carry off his children before they are able to have their father’s name pass to a second generation.
13~“<l>Iniquitas patrum ejus</s>” The iniquity of the fathers of this same people, to be punished in him, as St. Augustine explains, applying the text of the Gospel: <l>Ut veniat super vos omnis sanguis Justus, qui effusus est super terram, a sanguine Abel...</s> That upon you may come all the just blood that hath been shed upon the earth from the blood of Abel... (Matt 23:33). “<l>Matris ejus.</s>” By this the holy Doctor understands Jerusalem.
14~“<l>Fiant contra Dominum semper.</s>” May the iniquity of their fathers and the sin of their mother, with their own crimes, be always before the eyes of God in punishment. 
15~“<l>Hominem inopem...</s>” Jesus Christ himself, who was thus treated without pity. 
16~“<l>Dilexit maledictionem.</s>” St. Augustine applies this to the time when the Jewish people cried out: <l>Sanguis ejus super nos et super filios nostros</s>—His blood be upon us and upon our children (Matt. 27:25).
17~That is, as St. Augustine explains: May cursing wrap round his body and penetrate within his soul. 
19~“<l>Hoc opus.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Hæc est retributio</s>—This is the punishment.
20~“<l>Propter nomen tuum.</s>” For the glory of Thy name. “<l>Suavis</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Bona.</s> Bent on helping the afflicted.
21~“<l>Cor meum conturbatum est intra me.</s>” St. Augustine refers this passage to what Jesus Christ said in the garden: <l>Tristis est anima mea usque ad mortem</s>—My soul is sorrowful even unto death (Matt 26:38).
22~“<l>Excusans sum sicut locustæ</s>” The locust goes lopping from place to place; and thus, says Du Hamel, did it happen to Jesus Christ: <l>Ex uno tribunali in aliud jactatus</s>—Who was cast about from one tribunal to another.
23~“<l>Propter oleum.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Absque oleo</s>—Without oil. We should then understand that ill and infirm condition of body was brought on not by the use of oil, but through being debarred from its use; for Estius, Sa, Mariana, Malvenda, Tirinus, and Mattei say that unctions with the use of oil were customary among the Hebrews, and that their health suffered if they failed to use them. Hence Mattei asserts that to understand here that flesh was lost by the use of oil is a most evident error. Besides, Bellarmine thus translates and explains the Hebrew literally: <l>Caro mea immutata est a pinguedine; id est, ex pingui macilenta reddita est.</s> And according to the Chaldee we read: <l>Macilenta est absque pinguedine.</s> The sense, therefore, is: My flesh has been changed from being fat, and is become lean for want of food that produces fatness. Otherwise, I do not see how this verse can with propriety be applied to Jesus Christ.
24~“<l>Moverunt capita sua.</s>” They shook their heads to insult me. This was verified, as Bellarmine remarks, when the enemies of Jesus Christ blasphemed him as he was on the cross: <l>Prætereuntes autem blasphemabant eum, moventes capita sua</s>—And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads (Matt 27:39).
26~That is, as Menochius explains it: Let them know that all that I have suffered, I have suffered by Thy will, according to the words of Isaias: <l>Propter scelus populi mei percussi eum</s>—For the wickedness of my people have I struck him (Is. 53:8).
27~“<l>Maledicent illi.</s>” They will curse me. And thus St. Paul wrote: <l>Christus nos redemit de maledicto legis, factus pro nobis maledictus</s>—Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us (Gal. 3:13). Du Hamel comments on the last words thus: <l>Nostram ipse suscipiens maledictionem</s>—Taking upon himself our curse. “<l>Confundantur.</s>” May they remain confounded, and be converted, as St. Augustine understands it.
28~“<l>Diploide.</s>” With a double cloak, that is, according to St. Augustine, both within and without.
29~“<l>Nimis ... In medio multorum.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Vehementer ... In medio populorum</s>—In the midst of the people.
30~He has stood at my side in my misery, to defend me and to save my life from the hands of my persecutors. Bellarmine understands this of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, whereby he resumed the life which the Jews had taken from him.
0~The reign of Jesus Christ, his eternal and temporal generation, his priesthood and his Passion, form the subject of this psalm. It is in the literal sense that we must understand it as referring to our Lord Jesus Christ; for he himself applies it to himself to convince the Jews that he is the true Son of God, as we read in the Gospel of St. Matthew, 22:44. In fact, after asking them how David can proclaim Christ his Lord, since Christ was to descend from him, David, he stated this irrefutable argument: If David calls him his Lord, how being his Lord could he be also his Son?—<l>Si ergo David vocat eum Dominum, quomodo filius ejus est?</s> (Matt. 22:45.) The Jews did not answer that the Messias could not be the Lord of David, as true God; but they would not allow that Jesus was the Messias or Christ of whom David had spoken. We Christians all believe that Jesus Christ was the true Messias. Thus are refuted the Arians who refuse to acknowledge Jesus Christ as the true Son of God, and true God as his Father. And in fact how can they speak thus since David proclaims as his Lord this same Jesus Christ as his Son?
1~“<l>Dixit Dominus Domino meo.</s>” That is: The eternal Father said to Jesus Christ. For “<l>Dominus Domino meo,</s>” the Hebrew reads: <l>Jehova Ladoni.</s> <l>Jehova</s> is a name that belongs to God only; it signifies HE WHO IS. The Hebrews through reverence did not pronounce the name of God. <l>Ladoni,</s> the dative of the word <l>Adoni,</s> means: To my Lord; the name that is applied to the Messias, not only as God, but also as man; and it is for this reason that David uses it here; for if he had designated Jesus Christ by the name of <l>Jehova,</s> he would have been understood as speaking of him as God only, and not as man. “<l>Sede a dextris meis.</s>” Be seated. “<l>Sede</s>” signifies supreme authority given to Jesus Christ as sitting at the right hand of God. “<l>A dextris meis.</s>” Equality of elevation. In reality Jesus Christ has the same dominion as his Father, not only as God, but as man, since his most sacred humanity has been raised to this exaltation by virtue of his hypostatic union with the Word, according to the words of St. Paul: <l>Qui, cum in forma Dei esset, non rapinam arbitratus est esse se æqualem Deo. ... Jesus Christus in gloria est Dei Patris</s>—Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. ... Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father (Phil. 2:6,11). There is no doubt that <l>In gloria Dei</s>—In the glory of God—is the same as <l>A dextris Dei</s>—At the right hand of God; that is: <l>In majestate Dei</s>—In the majesty of God. So St. Mark (16:19), speaking of our Saviour ascended into heaven, says: <l>Assumptus est in cælum, et sedet a dextris Dei</s>—He was taken into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God. St. Ambrose thus comments: <l>Audit quasi Homo, sedet quasi Dei filius</s>—He hears as man, he sits as the Son of God (De David, apol. 2).
2~That is: Thou shalt reign at my right hand, even during the time that Thou shalt subdue Thy enemies; according to what St. Paul writes: <l>Oportet autem illum regnare, donec ponat omnes inimicos sub pedibus ejus</s>—For he must reign until he hath put all his enemies under his feet (1 Cor. 15:25). The word <l>Donec</s> here signifies according to interpreters <si>As long as,</s> since, as Mattei says, <l>Donec</s> does not always imply the termination of what is spoken of.
3~Here David speaks to Jesus Christ, and says to him: The Lord, that is, Thy eternal Father, will cause to come forth from Sion, or from Jerusalem, the sceptre of Thy power, and Thy reign shall extend over the whole earth. This accords with the command given by the divine Master to his disciples to go to preach salvation to all nations beginning with Jerusalem: <l>Prædicari, in nomine ejus, pœnitentiam et remissionem peccatorum in omnes gentes, incipientibus ab Jerusalem</s>—That penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name, ... beginning at Jerusalem (Luke 24:4). Mattei observes that by “<l>Virgam</s>” many of the holy Fathers understand the cross, which is the sceptre of Jesus Christ.
4~There are in this verse several words difficult to understand: of these the interpreters give various explanations. “<l>Tecum principium.</s>” Some understand by “<l>Principium</s>” the divine Word himself, who is also the principle, according to the words of Jesus Christ: <l>Sicut tu, Pater, in me, et ego in te</s>—As Thou, Father, in Me, and I in Thee (John 17:21). But <l>Principium</s> is commonly explained as <l>Principatus;</s> Principality or Dominion, and this agrees with the rendering of the Septuagint. Thus Tertullian understands it, who writes: <l>Principium pro principatu sumetur</s> (Adv. Hermog. c. 9). “<l>In die virtutis tuæ.</s>” Mattei, according to the authority, as he says, of several holy Fathers, explains this of eternity: <l>Ab æterno.</s> But others, with great probability, apply it to the day of the last judgment, when Jesus Christ will display his power over all creatures; and this is the explanation of St. Augustine, Theodoret, Lallemant, and many others. “<l>In splendoribus sanctorum.</s>” That is: When the eternal Judge shall be surrounded by the saints, who will shine forth as so many suns. <l>Tunc justi fulgebunt sicut sol</s>—Then shall the just shine as the sun (Matt. 13:43). “<l>Ex utero ante luciferum genui te.</s>” This is to be understood, according to St. Thomas, of the eternal generation of the Word: I have begotten Thee before the star called Lucifer, that is, to put a part for the whole, before all creatures; and I have begotten Thee from my womb “<l>Ex utero,</s>” that is to say, from my substance, as St. Jerome explains: <l>De sua natura, substantia.</s> The sense, then, of the verse is this: My Son, Thy princedom over all created things shall appear when Thou shalt sit on Thy throne in the midst of the saints, who shall shine as stars or suns, to judge the world; for I have begotten Thee of my substance before the existence of the stars and of all other creatures, even from eternity.
5~The Lord has sworn, and will never repent of it; it is an oath and an immutable decree. He has said: Thou art priest eternal, according to the order of Melchisedech, in contradistinction to the priests according to the order of Aaron, who were subject to change and death. Jesus Christ is a Priest forever, because even in heaven he offers the merits of his Passion for the salvation of men who live on this earth; and even after the end of the world he will ever continue to offer them on behalf of men in thanksgiving for the graces bestowed upon them by God. There is also this difference between the sacrifices of the Old Law that in it animals were offered; while that of Melchisedech, in which bread and wine were offered, was a figure of the sacrifice of Mass, wherein Jesus Christ is the principal Sacrificer.
6~The Lord shall always be at Thy side, and in the day of his just vengeance he will overthrow the power of those kings who are Thy enemies. Here Mattei justly remarks that according to the Hebrew, instead of “<l>A dextris tuis,</s>” it is <l>Super dextera tua.</s> Hence these words mean here, not that Jesus Christ is to sit at the right hand of God, as some understand them, but that the eternal Father, “<l>Dominus,</s>” will give to Jesus Christ the strength to vanquish all his enemies.
7~Jesus Christ shall judge the rebellious nations, and will carry into effect the chastisements with which they have been threatened; he shall shiver in pieces on the earth the proud heads that rose up against him.
8~Mattei with Marcus Marinus gives this interpretation: He shall cause the blood of his enemies to flow like a torrent in which he will quench his thirst. But others give this explanation: Nevertheless this God made man shall first during his mortal life drink the water of the torrent, that is, the chalice of his Passion, which like a torrent of pains shall overwhelm him to death; but in consequence of this death, he shall lift up his head; for thereby he shall be exalted to a throne of glory, according to the words of the Apostle: <l>Videmus Jesum, propter passionem mortis, gloria et honore coronatum, ut, gratia Dei, pro omnibus gustaret mortem</s>—We see Jesus ... for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, ... that through the grace of God he might taste death for all (Heb. 2:9). Blessed death, which has restored life to all men!
0~In this psalm the perfections of God are exalted, and he is praised for the wonders that he has wrought in behalf of his people.
1~“<l>In consilio ... et congregatione.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In secreto ... et synagoga.</s> That is: In private gatherings and in public assemblies.
2~All the works of the Lord are great; for in all, his infinite wisdom and power shine forth; and all are perfect, since they all correspond to the intentions of his holy will.
3~All his works are so many motives for us to praise and magnify him; he it is that does all things; and everything that he does is always just.
4~The Lord, who is merciful and (according to the Hebrew text) full of paternal tenderness, has left the memorial of his admirable prodigies which he has wrought in favor of his people, especially in the miraculous food, the manna, which he gave to our fathers, who had the gift of his holy fear. Everyone knows that this manna was a figure of the Holy Eucharist, that most admirable work which Jesus Christ left on earth as a memorial of the death which he suffered for us.
5~“<l>Virtutem.</s>” That is: The grandeur, the strength, the wisdom.
6~“<l>Hæreditatem gentium.</s>” The Land of Promise in possession of the Gentiles. “<l>Opera manuum ejus, veritas et judicium.</s>” In a word, his works show forth to us his fidelity and his justice.
7~His laws ever righteous are unchangeable.
8~He has sent redemption to his people, that is, the Redeemer, as St. Augustine and Euthymius explain, and he has made a covenant with them which shall never be broken.
9~His name is holy and terrible; we must, therefore, greatly fear to violate his covenant, and be careful to preserve the fear of the Lord, without which we cannot possess wisdom.
10~They have a good intelligence, that is, they rightly understand this salutary fear who act up to it; hence he who keeps this fear shall be forever praised. “<l>Facientibus eum.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Facientibus ea,</s> that is, <l>mandata,</s> the commandments. Mattei says that it is the same in substance, though the Hebrew makes us better understand that speculative fear is not enough if we would have the wisdom of the saints, but that we must live practically according to this fear in order to be truly wise. Among those that have the fear of God there are many who, because they lead a bad life, are the greatest fools in the world.
0~The prophet describes in this psalm the character of the just man and his temporal happiness which he enjoys here below, according to the promises that God made in the Old Law. But we, who love in the New Law, should raise ourselves to the thought of the spiritual happiness that God makes the just taste in this life and in the next.
1~He that fears God as he ought, that is, with a fear not servile but filial, takes all his delight in observing his precepts. St. Jerome says: <l>Anxie mandata ejus non facit, sed vult:</s> The just man obeys not by force, but with a good will, and loves to obey.
3~His house shall enjoy honors and riches; and with all his honors and riches he will firmly persevere in his holy life, and will not regret at leaving them, because the reward due to his justice shall be everlasting in the life to come.
4~The light that comes from the Lord shall not fail the righteous in the darkness of their afflictions; for God will come to their aid, since he is full of mercy and goodness, and a just rewarder of his servants.
5~“<l>Jucundus.</s>” Mattei says that according to the Hebrew this word signifies <l>Beatus.</s> Happy is the man that exercises mercy towards the poor, at least in lending them what they need; he will regulate his words and his temporal affairs, or will manage his possessions “<l>in judicio,</s>” with prudence, so that he will never be disturbed in his happiness.
6~The just man shall live forever in the memory of men, and he will not fear to lose his character by the calumnies of his enemies.
8~He has given generously of his goods to the poor; his justice, that is, his good deeds, his merits, shall ever be before the eyes of God, to be recompensed eternally in heaven, and he shall be exalted in power and in glory.
9~At seeing this the sinner will be angry; he will gnash with his teeth for rage, and pine away with spite and envy; he would wish to deprive the just man of his happiness, but the desires of the wicked shall vanish as smoke.
0~The psalmist invites just souls to praise God for the care that he takes of all his creatures, even of the most humble.
1~“<l>Pueri.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Servi</s>—Servants.
5~Who can be compared with our God, whose goodness is such that from the highest heaven where he dwells he does not disdain to look upon the creatures that are the most lowly.
8~This verse applies well to Jesus Christ, who, when the Church was bereaved of children by the perversion of the Jews, made her by his redemption the mother of all the faithful.
0~The psalmist shows the wonders wrought by the Lord to deliver the people from the slavery of Egypt. He then exhibits what is the folly of the Gentiles to put their trust in vain idols, and he urges the faithful people to put their confidence in our true God, and to perseverance in his service.
1,2~When the people of Israel were delivered from the yoke of the Egyptians, God consecrated them to his service, wishing henceforth to rule over them alone.
3~The Red Sea beheld the Hebrews pursued by the Egyptians, and fled, that is, drew back to afford an open passage to the people of God. The river Jordan turned back, that is, its waters stopped in their course, and lifted themselves up on high (Jos. 3:13) that the faithful people might pass over.
4~Then the mountains exult with joy. Others apply this verse to the trembling of the mountains when the law was given to Moses. I prefer the first sense as agreeing better with the following verse.
10~Protect us for Thy mercy’s sake, and according to the faithfulness of Thy promises, lest the impious should say in case Thou shouldst abandon us: Where now is their God to help them?
16~Let those who with their own hands make to themselves such gods, and all those that put their trust in them, become like unto them.
20~“<l>Benedixit nobis.</s>” He has blessed us, loading us with graces.
25~“<l>Cælum cæli.</s>” The Empyrean, (<si>Highest Heaven</s>) as Lallemant and others explain it. The Lord has created the empyrean heaven for himself, that is, to reign there; and he has given the earth to men for their habitation, that they may there gain merit to be raised to the empyrean.
26~That is: After death no one can do good works any more.
27~That is: We who enjoy the life of grace, let us bless the Lord at the present time, and let us hope to bless him for all eternity.
0~In this psalm David thanks God for having delivered him from the persecution of Absalom. The royal prophet is here the figure of the Christian soul, which, after suffering many dangerous temptations, finds itself at the approach of death victorious over its enemies and on the point of going to heaven to enjoy its God.
1~I have loved and love my Lord; for he has heard, and I hope will always hear my prayer.
2~He has inclined his ear to my voice; therefore I will never cease to call upon him all the days of my life, confiding in his mercy.
3~Lallemant and Mattei explains this verse as referring to the fears and dangers of losing the life of the body; but Bellarmine interprets it thus: Deadly temptations have surrounded me which would draw me to eternal death, and these temptations have brought me near to the danger of being condemned to hell.
4,5~In this state I found nothing on all sides but afflictions and sorrows; then I had recourse to the Lord, and called upon his name, saying: My God, deliver my soul from these perils. The Lord is as merciful as he is just; he is our God, and he shows mercy to those that have recourse to him.
6~“<l>Parvulos.</s>” The little ones who are humble.
7~“<l>In requiem tuam.</s>” To the place of thy repose, that is, to the heavenly country, as Bellarmine with St. Basil understand it. “<l>Benefecit tibi.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Retribuit super te</s>—The Lord will recompense thee according to thy good works, by giving thee eternal life, which is a crown of justice. Thus again Bellarmine with St. Basil interprets the words.
9~I hope, then, to find myself in the land of the living, far from hell, where all are dead, and far from this world, where so many are also dead through sin, and there I shall be happy, occupied forever in pleasing the Lord.
0~This psalm does not differ from the preceding; but in it David shows yet more his gratitude for the graces which he acknowledges that he has received from his goodness.
1~This verse is clearly explained by St. Paul: <l>Habentes autem eundem spiritum fidei, sicut scriptum est: Credidi propter quod locutus sum; et nos credimus, propter quod et loquimur</s>—But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written: I believe, for which cause I have spoken: we also believe, for which cause we speak also (2 Cor. 4:13.) Hence this explanation: Resting on faith I have hoped in God; and I therefore said: Thou art my hope; and this I said on beholding myself so deeply humiliated and afflicted.
2~The following is the explanation given by Bellarmine, with Euthymius: In my ecstasy when my spirit was raised to the knowledge of the land of the living, I said that every man is a liar, that is, that when men talk of this world’s happiness they only speak lies.
4~By the chalice of salvation St. Basil, St. Jerome, St. Augustine, Theodoret, and Euthymius, according to Bellarmine, understand the chalice of the Passion of Jesus Christ, of which he himself spoke thus: <l>Calicem quem dedit mihi Pater, non bibam illum?</s>—The chalice which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? (John 18:11) Hence this explanation: Having nothing to present to God for the graces that he has bestowed upon us, I will offer him in thanksgiving the sufferings of Jesus Christ, to which I will unite those that I endure; and I will always invoke the name of the Lord, that he may enable me to bear my pains with patience.
6~“<l>Quia ego servus tuus.</s>” That is: I will pay my vows to Thee, for I am Thy servant.
0~This psalm invites all the people to praise the mercy and the faithfulness of the Lord for having united them all in one and the same Church. It is thus that the Apostle interprets this psalm in his Epistle to the Romans (15:8-11).
2~That is: He has multiplied upon us the effects of his mercy; and his faithfulness in the promises that he has made to us shall never fail.
0~David offers here his solemn thanksgiving for the victory that he gained over his enemies, and for all the other benefits that had been conferred upon him; he thanks him specially for having given to the world Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of mankind.
1-4~The prophet begins by inviting all men to praise God for the mercy that he continually exercises towards them. He then calls specially on the Israelites, among whom were all the apostles; he next invites all the priests, who were to propagate the holy faith; and lastly all the faithful.
5~“<l>In latitudine.</s>” By sending me abundant help.
6,7~God is my protector; this is the reason why I shall fear nothing of all the evils that men think to do me; I will despise all the efforts and snares of my enemies.
10-12~“<l>Ultus sum.</s>” I have been revenged. It must be observed that this expression is not to be understood here of vengeance properly speaking, but of a victory gained over the enemy. It applies specially to Jesus Christ triumphing over his enemies, and to all the faithful who by his help overcome their temptations. We may, then, take these three verses together, and explain them thus: My enemies have closed in around me from every side, as an angry swarm of bees, or as a burning flame in a bundle of thorns; but thanks to the protection of the Lord, I have been avenged on them, that is, I have overcome them all.
15~In the tabernacles or tents of the just, no voices were heard but of gladness and victory in thanksgiving to God for having saved me, and caused me to triumph over my enemies.
16~The hand of God in aiding me has shown forth its strength.
17~“<l>Non moriar.</s>” As I shall not die as my enemies had hoped.
18~“<l>Castigans castigavit me.</s>” He has chastised me, but with the tender compassion of a father.
19~The gates of justice are the gates of heaven; for justice is the gate of the kingdom of God; hence we should seek it before all things: <l>Quærite ergo primum regnum Dei, et justitiam ejus</s>—Seek first the kingdom of God and his justice (Matt. 6:33). Since justice is the only gate by which we can come to God, it is only the just that enter through it. Such is the sense given to this passage by St Jerome, St. John Chrysostom, and St. Augustine.
20~Once having entered this gate, as I have desired, I will, O my God! sing Thy praises always, and render Thee thanks for having heard my prayer, and for having become my Saviour.
21~This verse is to be understood only of Jesus Christ and his Church as St. Peter explains it to the Jews: <l>Hic est lapis qui reprobatus est a vobis ædificantibus, qui factus est in caput anguli</s>—This is the stone which was rejected by you the builders: which is become the head of the corner (Acts 4:11). God sent upon earth this most precious Stone, that is, his own beloved Son; but the Jews, who at that time formed the Church, rejected him. This Stone, however, became the head of the corner, joining together the two walls, namely, the Hebrew nation and the Gentile people, into one Church.
23~This is specially a happy day; it is a particular work of God: let it ever be a day of joy and thanksgiving for the immense benefits received.
24~Save me, O Lord! and be ever gracious to me, so that I may never cease to repeat: Blessed be he that is come in the name of the Lord to save us! This precisely was the cry of the multitude when Jesus Christ made his triumphant entry into Jerusalem: <l>Hosanna Filio David! benedictus, qui venit in nomine Domini!</s>—Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord (Matt. 21:9).
25,26~We wish and bespeak you a thousand blessings, you who are of the Church of the Lord; for he is the true God, and he has manifested himself to us by taking to him our human flesh. Celebrate, then, this day with solemn pomp by adorning the temple even to the altar with green and leafy boughs.
0~In the Hebrew text the first eight verses of this psalm begin each by the first letter of the alphabet, the eight following by the second, and so on with the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. This seems to have been done to help the memory. The learned say that this psalm is so long because it was composed with a view of giving pious and profitable occupation to the people who used to recite or chant it on their way three times a year when they visited the Temple. It is filled with praises of the divine law, with prayers for grace to observe it perfectly, with petitions for help in the dangers that beset us, whether on the part of men, or especially of the evil spirits who seek to destroy the life of our soul. In the divine Office the psalm is divided into eleven parts of sixteen verses each, distributed among the Little Hours, namely: Prime, Terce, Sext, and None. As the Little Hours are always the same, and have to be recited daily, it will be of much help when reciting them to give the attention of the mind to the petitions which the verses contain.

Preserve me from this misery, because I wish to accomplish in all things Thy holy will.
23,24~The powerful ones of the earth have designedly set themselves to speak evil of me; but Thy servant, nevertheless, has not ceased to exercise himself in all Thy just ordinances; for I meditate ever upon these testimonies of Thy will, and they counsel me how I should conduct myself.
25~“<l>Pavimento.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Pulveri</s>—To the dust. My soul has become attached to the earth, and thus has lost the life of Thy grace. Restore to me, O Lord, this life according to the promise that Thou hast made to hear him that prays.
26~I have exposed to Thee the disorders of my life, and my needs, and when imploring Thy mercy Thou didst hear me. Deign then to teach me what I must do in future to observe all Thy precepts.
27~Instruct me how to walk always in the way of Thy commandments, and so shall I exercise myself in keeping Thy precepts, which are wonderful, that is, difficult, nay, impossible to observe without Thy help, but easy with Thy grace.
28~My soul has slumbered, that is, has become lukewarm in Thy service, through the weariness that I found therein. Give me strength to fulfil whatever Thou commandest me.

42~To those that reproach me for living in this state of humiliation, I will answer that I hope in Thy promises, which can never fail.
43~Permit not that I ever fail of telling the truth, for I have placed all my hopes in Thy judgments, which are full of mercy.
45~By the effect of Thy love which enlarges hearts, I have found myself at large walking in the way of Thy precepts, for I have sought to observe them with exactness.

50~This hope has consoled me in my tribulations, for Thy promise has given me strength to suffer them with patience.
51~My enemies, proud of their power, have hitherto unjustly persecuted me, but I have never failed in the observance of Thy law.
52~We here remark that we should fear the judgments of God if we are unfaithful to him; but when we are faithful to him, with his help, which we shall certainly obtain if we are careful to ask it of him by prayer, the judgments of God should not terrify, but should rather console us; for these judgments are full of joy and comfort, because full of mercy, as David says in verse 39: <l>Judicia tua jucunda</s>—Thy judgments are pleasant. This is the reason why he adds in verse 43, that in his confidence in these same judgments he places all his hope of salvation: <l>Quia in judiciis tuis supersperavi</s>—For in Thy judgments I have hoped exceedingly.

69~The iniquity of the proud, who are properly the infernal spirits, is multiplied against me, to make me transgress Thy law; but I will ever study with all my heart to enter into the purposes of Thy holy will concerning me, that I may accomplish them.
70~“<l>Coagulatum est sicut lac.</s>” Is hardened like curdled milk.
71~“<l>Ut discam justificationes tuas.</s>” That I may learn how to keep Thy precepts. We may here remark how necessary it is to keep ourselves humble before God and before men; for the Lord, as he did with David, is wont to chastise the proud, by permitting them to fall into shameful sins such as they had previously held in abhorrence.
73~Thy hands have formed me so that I am the work of Thy hands; but by sin I have lost the knowledge and the love of Thy law; give me, then, understanding to know it, and love to keep it.

81~My soul has fainted away for desire to see myself saved from so many anguishes and fears that torment me; all my hope is in Thy promise.
82~My eyes too have grown faint through keeping them fixed on Thee, expecting the effect of Thy word.
83~“<l>Pruina.</s>” This word has given rise to different interpretations. Mattei thinks that it is put in place of <l>Fumo:</s> In the smoke; because the Hebrew word is thus rendered by St. Jerome in Genesis (19:28), and Emmanuel Sa explains it in the same sense according to the Chaldee: <l>Ad fumum.</s> So that the meaning of the passage would be: By reason of my sufferings I am become like a skin that has become shrivelled and blackened by the smoke. But others keeping to the Vulgate explain it thus: The sufferings that I have endured have made me become like a skin grown slack by the damp, and then is contracted and hardened by the frost; that is to say, have made me become tepid. Of these two interpretations the reader can choose the one that most approves itself to him. For my part, I prefer the second, because it is in conformity with the letter of the Vulgate and is the one most commonly received.
84~How many days must Thy servant remain thus tried? When wilt Thou pass judgment on my persecutors, and punish them as they deserve?
85~These wicked men have set before my eyes the goods of this world, which in truth are all deceitful fables when confronted with Thy law, which alone satisfies him who keeps it.
86~“<l>Veritas.</s>” They are the very truth, which gives true peace to him who observes them.
87~They had all but ruined me here on earth with their temptations; but with Thy help I have not ceased to obey Thy precepts.
89-92~These four verses are variously interpreted. The best and most suitable explanation appears to me to be that given by Mattei, with Bossuet and several others, according to which David means here to say: O Lord, the heavens obey Thee, by always remaining in the state wherein Thou hast placed them; in like manner the earth remains the same as when Thou didst first establish it; so, too, the day and all irrational creatures obey Thee. After this the psalmist concludes: if I had not obeyed Thee myself, by meditating and observing Thy law in the numerous persecutions that I have suffered, I should have perished through my weakness.
93~“<l>Vivificasti me.</s>” Thou hast preserved my life.
94~I belong to Thee, and I have given myself to Thee; Thou hast to save me, for I have tried to obey Thy ordinances.
95~Sinners watched their opportunity to strike me down; but I have taken care not to withdraw from Thy precepts.
96~I have seen that all things come to an end; but the law that Thou hast given us will endure forever. Thus Mattei and Bossuet explain this verse after Theodoret.
97~In what way have I loved Thy law? I have loved it by meditating upon it every day.

108~Graciously accept the free offerings of my mouth, and teach me to observe Thy law.
109~“<l>Anima mea in manibus meis.</s>” That is: My life is in danger. In the same way it is said of David: <l>Posuit animam suam in manu sua</s>—He put his life in his hand (1 Kings 19:5). The proper version, therefore, of this verse is: My life is always in danger, because I wish to keep Thy law; but I will never forget it.
111~I have chosen for my heritage to accomplish always Thy will, for it is the joy of my heart.
112~“<l>Propter retributionem.</s>” Mindful of the recompense that Thou hast promised to Thy faithful servants.
114~“<l>In verbum tuum supersperavi.</s>” In Thy promise I have put all my confidence.
115~Come not to disturb me; I wish to give myself to search into the precepts of my God, that I may observe them with exactness.
116~O Lord, take me under Thy protection, as Thou hast promised, that I may live to Thee; do not, I beseech Thee, permit me to fall into the confusion of being deprived of the help that I expect from Thee.
118~“<l>Injusta cogitatio eorum.</s>” They give themselves to thoughts contrary to justice.
119~Sinners are such so far as they transgress the divine law; for where there is no law there is no sin.
120~Pierce through and restrain my flesh, that is, my carnal appetites, with Thy holy fear, for Thy judgments make me tremble.
121~I have always taken care to observe justice; suffer not that I remain abandoned in the hands of my calumniators.

125~I am Thy servant, obliged to obey Thee; make me understand well Thy commands, that I may know them and put them in execution.
126~It is time to manifest Thy justice against those that destroy Thy law.
127~For my part, this shameful conduct of theirs moves me to love Thy precepts more than gold and precious stones.
128~Therefore have I set myself not to transgress any one of Thy precepts; and I have abhorred not iniquity only, but also every occasion that might lead me to sin.
129~Thy law and all the truths that Thou hast revealed to us are indeed worthy of our admiration; therefore has my soul studied to penetrate them.
130~When the hidden sense of the divine Scriptures is explained by the holy Doctors, there arises a light that dispels the darkness and that gives to the humble the true intelligence in which the proud can have no part.
131~I opened my mouth in prayer to Thee, and have received from Thee the good spirit, that is, the help to keep Thy commandments; for my desire is to fulfil them exactly.

133~Make me conduct myself according to Thy law, and permit not that any unjust passion should have dominion over me.

140~“<l>Ignitum.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Probatum et examinatum igne</s>—Proved and tried in the fire. That is: Thy law is most pure, as gold refined by fire; and it inflames hearts with an ardent love; therefore I have always loved Thee.
141~I am a young man of but few years and without consideration; but I do not forget Thy precepts.
142~“<l>Veritas.</s>” See verses 86 and 151.

3~“<l>Ejus.</s>” Redundance common in the Hebrew. “<l>In idipsum.</s>” That is: <l>Simul:</s> Altogether. “<l>Participatio in idipsum.</s>” Bellarmine explains: Charity which unites friends, makes all goods common among them, and all become the joy of each.
4~“<l>Testimonium Israel.</s>” This is understood of the law by which the Israelites were obliged at fixed periods to worship God in the Temple; but on applying it to heaven, it has reference to the souls of the just, who will ascend thither to be solely occupied in praising the Lord.

5~The Lord will treat those that fail in their duties, departing from the right way, as he treats the wicked; but Israel shall always enjoy peace. “<l>Obligationes.</s>” According to the Hebrew and the Greek, as Bellarmine explains it with St. Jerome and Euthymius: <l>Pravitates, Obliquitates</s>—Crooked ways. The prophet said, v. 4, that God will reward the just; he adds here that as to those that turn from an upright heart by engaging in crooked ways, by compounding with their consciences, shall end by finding themselves among the declared enemies, in the midst of the evils that await them, while peace with all its happiness shall be shared by the true servants of God.
0~This psalm contains the sighs of the Jews to be released from captivity at Babylon. It is of service to sinners who wish to be delivered from this slavery of sin, and to the just who sigh for the end of their exile here on earth.

This is well expressed in the Greek version in this sense: The multitude of children shall be the inheritance of the Lord, and the recompense of Jesus Christ, who was properly the fruit of Mary’s womb.
5~These children, tormented by persecutions, shall be against their enemies as so many arrows in the hand of a strong man.

3,4~If instead of thinking humbly of myself, I have been exalted in mind above what is becoming, I am content to be punished, and treated as a babe that lies wailing at its mother’s breast when deprived of milk.

1~“<l>Tu cognovisti sessionem meam et resurrectionem meam.</s>” Thou hast known perfectly the time when I should sit down and when I should rise up, that is, when I should take repose and when I should work; this taken in a moral sense may mean: the time when I should be humbled and when exalted.

7-9~That is: Thou art in every place through Thy immensity, and Thou exercisest everywhere Thy power. I shall be unable to free myself.
10~St. Jerome translates this verse thus: <l>Si dixero: Forte tenebræ operient me; nox quoque lux erit circa me.</s> Hence the verse is thus explained: If I should say that perhaps darkness will hide me from Thy eyes, I should deceive myself; for night from Thy eyes is a light that surrounds me, and discovers to Thee all my actions. But we may also, as Bellarmine observes, explain the words of the Vulgate in this manner: If I should hide myself in the darkness of the night in order not to be seen, while indulging in pleasures so shameful as shun the light of day, still I could not for all that withdraw myself from Thy gaze.
12~“<l>Renes meos.</s>” That is: The most inward parts of my body, and consequently my affections and my desires.
13~O Lord! I will praise Thee always, because Thou hast made me know Thy greatness in a fearful manner, that is, Thou who commandest respect and a holy fear in Thy admirable works which my soul knows too well not to be greatly impressed.
14~Of all that Thou hast in secret formed within me, that is, my bowels and bones, nothing is hidden before Thee; so that the whole substance of my body is known to Thee, as also whatever is hidden in the deepest bowels of the earth.
15~Thy eyes have seen my imperfection, that is, my body, when it was shapeless, without distinction of members; for in Thy book, that is, in Thy mind, all men are found written, so that Thou knowest what is to become of them. The meaning is brought out better by what follows: “<l>Dies formabuntur, et nemo in eis.</s>” Menochius explains: Days shall succeed to days, and not one of them shall be missing in Thy book so as to escape Thy knowledge.
16~“<l>Mihi.</s>” To my mind, according to my judgment. Thou honorest and Thou exaltest Thy enemies in calling them to enjoy eternal glory when they shall be made princes of the eternal kingdom.
17~“<l>Ex surrexi.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Evigilavi</s>—Have wakened from sleep. “<l>Adhuc sum tecum.</s>” That is: I am united with Thee up to the present moment, and I hope to continue thus united till the end.
18,19~I know, on the other hand, that Thou wilt destroy the wicked, and I say to them: Men of blood, depart from me; for you say in your thought, that is, among yourselves: In vain, O Lord! will Thy servants occupy the cities that Thou hast given them.
22,23~Prove me, and penetrate all the affections of my heart; interrogate me, that is, examine me and weigh all my ways, all my actions, and if Thou seest that I am in the way of iniquity, do Thou lead me into the eternal way, that is, make me walk by that way which will bring me to the possession of eternal good.
0~David implores help from God against Saul, and against those that spoke calumniously of him to that prince.
5,6~That is: They use every means in their power to make me fall into their hands.
8~“<l>Obumbrasti.</s>” Thou hast extended Thy shadow, Thy protection.
9~“<l>Ne tradas me ... peccatori.</s>” Bellarmine renders these words thus: <l>Ne sinas me tradi ... dæmoni</s>—Suffer me not to be given over to the devil. The verse, then, is explained as follows: Permit not that, drawn by my concupiscence, I give myself over into the hands of the enemy. These enemies have no other thought than to injure me; do not Thou abandon me lest they should boast of having conquered me.
10~If Thou dost assist me, the whole force of their wiles with which they seek to circumvent me in various ways, and the evil they strive so hard to do me by their calumnies, all this will cover their own selves by falling back upon them.
11~“<l>Carbones.</s>” Burning coals, that is, the afflictions that they devised for me. “<l>In miseriis non subsistent.</s>” Their miseries shall be such that they will not fail to be crushed by them.
12~The man that makes an ill use of his tongue to lie, to detract, and to injure his neighbor; and the evils that shall afflict him, far from making him gain merit by patience, will only serve to sink him deeper in eternal death.

3~That is: Permit not that any inconsiderate word escape me that could cause Thee displeasure.
4,5~And if even through weakness I should offend Thee, suffer me not to speak maliciously by seeking to excuse my sins. This is what wicked men do; but I do not wish to have part with them, nor share in the disorders that are their chief delight.
6~That is: I prefer the charitable corrections and reproaches of the just to the flatteries of the wicked.
7~This verse is very obscure; according to St. John Chrysostom it is thus explained: I will not only have no communication with the wicked, but moreover my prayer to God is that he will not allow me to find delight in those things that please them; they will perish along with their judges, that is, their chiefs who lead them on to evil; these indeed have already perished by striking against the rock which has caused their wreck.
8~This verse is also very obscure; it is thus explained: I hope nevertheless that they will hear my words; for they are such as will have power to make them repent, and as the hardened earth yields to the spade and is broken up, so their obstinacy will be broken and yield to my persuasions.
9~Our bones have been scattered, that is, our strength is weakened, so that we find ourselves as it were on the brink of the grave; but, O Lord, my eyes turn to Thee; in Thee have I put my hopes, give me not up to death.
11~The wicked ones shall be caught in the snares that they laid for me; for myself, I hope to be in a special manner protected by Thee until I am out of danger.
0~According to interpreters, this psalm is the prayer that David, hiding in the cave of Odollam, addressed to God in order to be delivered from the imminent danger in which he found himself.
3~Seeing that I have not the strength to resist my enemies, I have recourse to Thee, my God, who knowest how perilous are the ways that I have to tread.
5~I turned to my right hand to see whether any one would help me; and I found not even one who seemed to know me.
6~It is not permitted me to save myself even by flight, and there is no one to have a care of my life.
7~“<l>Portio mea.</s>” My portion, that is, my inheritance, all my goods.
10~Take me out of this prison, in order that I may be able to praise Thy name; the just await me, till Thou restore to me the freedom which I desire.

6~I have stretched forth my hands towards Thee, to obtain mercy, for my soul is become as dried up earth; it is unable to serve Thee, seeing itself deprived of the water of Thy grace.
7~Make haste to hear me, O Lord! and strengthen me by Thy grace, for I feel my spirit fainting in me.
9~Make me soon hear the voice of Thy mercy; telling me that Thou hast pardoned me; for in Thee alone have I placed all my hope of salvation.
10~“<l>Ad te levavi animam meam.</s>” That is: I have resolved to detach myself from all earthly affections, to please only Thee.
11~“<l>Deus meus es tu.</s>” Thou art my God; and therefore Thou deservest that I should not do anything except what Thou willest.
12~Thy good spirit, that is, the Holy Ghost, will conduct me, while here upon earth, by the right way; I hope, for the glory of Thy name, that Thou wilt grant me vigor and strength to live according to Thy justice, that is, to lead the life of the just. “<l>In æquitate tua.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In justitia tua.</s>
13~I hope that Thou wilt deliver my soul from eternal tribulation.

4~He sends his commands, and they arrive promptly.
5~“<l>Dat nivem sicut lanam.</s>” That is: He showers down snow from heaven in such quantities to benefit the earth, that its flakes form as it were a quilt of wool. “<l>Nebulam.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Pruinam</s>—Hoar-frost.

4~“<l>Aquæ omnes quæ super cælos sunt.</s>” With regard to these waters there are various opinions. Some, as St. Bonaventure, Ambrose and Catharinus, etc., say that they are the crystalline heaven. Others, as St. Athanasius (Cont. Arian. or. 2, n. 28, E.B.), St. Basil (In Hexam. hom. 3), St. Ambrose (Hexam. l. 2, c. 2,3), St. John Chrysostom (In Genes, hom. 4), Bede (In Hexam.), etc., believe that these waters are above the firmament or starry heavens, and they cite for this opinion Genesis: <l>Et fecit Deus firmamentum, divisitque aquas quæ erant sub firmamento, ab his quæ erant super firmamentum</s>—And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament from those that were above the firmament (Gen. 1:7). And St. Augustine, who holds the same view, says: <l>Major est Scripturæ hujus auctoritas, quam omnis humani ingenii capacitas</s>—The authority of this Scripture is greater than all the capacity of the human mind (De Gen. ad litt. l. 2, c. 5, n. 9). This opinion is also followed by many modern interpreters cited by Tirinus. Others, in fine, such as Rupert, Lorinus, Mariana, etc., with the greatest number of modern commentators, understand by these waters the clouds that are suspended over the earth.

0~In this psalm, as well as in [Palms 148 and 150], all creatures are called upon to praise and thank the Lord for the victory gained over the enemies of his holy name. In an allegorical sense all Christians are invited to bless God for the victory that he helped them to gain over the devil, the world, and the flesh; a victory so great that for it they will be honored by being appointed judges at the day of judgment.
1~Sing to the Lord a new canticle for all the new benefits that he has bestowed upon us, and especially for having given us Jesus Christ for our Redeemer: it is just that in the assembly of the saints, that is, of Christians, the praises of the Lord should ever resound.

1~“<l>In sanctis ejus.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>In sanctuario ejus</s>—In his sanctuary, which is principally heaven. “<l>In firmamento virtutis ejus.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>In fortitudine potentiæ ejus</s>—In the strength of his power. The almighty power of God shines forth in a special manner in the firmament, or in the heavens, as is the meaning of the word <l>Firmamentum</s> given in the first chapter of Genesis.
2~“<l>In virtutibus ejus.</s>” In the effects of his power, or in the marvels that he works.
4~“<l>Choro.</s>” Some think that this expression means here some musical instrument, now unknown to us; others that it signifies a concert of voices.
