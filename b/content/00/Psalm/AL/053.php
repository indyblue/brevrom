0~Prayer that David addresses to God to deliver him from the soldiers of Saul by whom he was surrounded. This psalm may serve for all Christians that find themselves assailed by the temptations of the devil. We may remark with Cardinal Bellarmine that the holy Church wishes to teach us how to arm ourselves with prayer against the tribulations and temptations that may assail us every day.
1~Save me, by the virtue and for the glory of Thy holy name, from the danger in which I am; judge me according to my innocence, and according to Thy power, which protects the innocent.
3~My own fellow-countrymen have separated themselves from me and, as foreign enemies, have armed themselves against me, in order to take away my life, having lost sight of God‘s justice.
4~“<l>Ecce enim.</s>” But I already know that, etc.
5~“<l>Averte mala.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Revertatur malum</s>—May evil return. Make, O God! to retort upon my enemies the evil that they have planned for me; scatter them according to Thy promises, which are always faithful and true.
6~Then with ready heart will I offer Thee sacrifices; and I will praise Thy holy name, so full of goodness to him that invokes Thee.
7~Through Thy mercy I find myself delivered by Thy hand from all anxiety, and my eyes shall be able to see with scorn my enemies cast down.
