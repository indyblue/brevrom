0~This psalm is a prayer which the people address to God for the success of the arms of David. But Bellarmine and Rotigni think that this psalm and the two following psalms, that is, 20 and 21 of the psalter, refer to the victories of Jesus Christ over the devil and the persecutors of the Church.
3~“<l>Holocaustum tuum pingue fiat.</s>” May thy holocaust be agreeable to the Lord, as are the sacrifices of fat animals (Dan. 3:40).
5~“<l>Salutari tuo.</s>” Thy safety and thy victory. “<l>Magnificabimur.</s>” Expression conformable to the Septuagint version. According to present Hebrew version, we would have: <l>Vexillum attolemus:</s> We shall lift up our banner. That is to say: We shall celebrate the victory that saves and exalts us by proclaiming the glory of the Lord, to whom it is due.
6~“<l>Christum suum.</s>” His Christ, or the King whom he hath anointed with his grace.
7~“<l>In potentatibus salus dexteræ ejus.</s>” St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>In fortitudinibus salutis dexteræ ejus.</s>
8~Our enemies put their trust in terrestrial goods and means; but we will invoke the name of our God, who gives victory to those that trust in him.
9~“<l>Obligati sunt.</s>” That is to say, according to the Septuagint version: <l>Colligati sunt, quasi compedibus</s>—They are tied down by earthly affections, as by so many fetters.
