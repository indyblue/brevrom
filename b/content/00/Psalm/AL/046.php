0~This psalm presents two literal senses: In the first, it refers to the triumph of the Ark when it was carried to Mount Sion (2 Kings 6:15); in the second sense, it is applied, according to the opinion of several of the holy Fathers, to the glorious Ascension of Jesus Christ into heaven.
2~He is the Lord, supreme above all by his majesty, terrible to all by his power; he is the great Monarch who holds dominion over the whole earth.
4~Among all the nations, he has chosen us to be his especial inheritance, because we are the children of Jacob, whom he so much loved.
5~“<l>Ascendit Deus.</s>” Our Lord ascends to heaven by his own power, because he is God.
7~“<l>Psallite sapienter.</s>” Render to him (wisely) the praises that he deserves, and as he deserves.
8~He shall reign as God over all nations; as God he shall sit upon his heavenly throne, at the right of the eternal Father.
9~“<l>Principes populorum congregati sunt cum Deo Abraham.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Congregati sunt, populus Dei Abraham</s>—The princes of the Gentile people are united with the people of the God of Abraham. “<l>Quoniam dii fortes terra vehementer elevati sunt.</s>” This passage is very obscure. Some, as Mattei and Genebrard, say that by the Hebrew word <l>Elohim</s> (the plural for the singular) <l>Dii fortes terra,</s> God himself is to be understood, and they explain the words thus: <l>Deus victoria elevatus est</s>—God is exalted in victory. But St. Cyril, Theodoret, and Didymus, understand by the words <l>Dii fortes terræ</s>—The princes of the earth. This agrees with the translation of St. Jerome: <l>Dii scuta terræ,</s> that is to say: The gods, the shields of the earth, that is, Protectors, those that have subjects under them. “<l>Elevati sunt.</s>” They have become exalted by being united in worshipping the true God. This last explanation pleases me more, because it is more in conformity with the Vulgate and the version of the Septuagint. The passage, then, may be thus explained: The princes, who are the protectors or rulers of the earth, have been greatly elevated by uniting in the worship of God.
