0~The object that David proposes to himself in this psalm is to convince us that God bestows happiness only upon the just in order to be happy; we must, therefore, begin to be just.
1~“<l>In cathedra pestilentiæ non sedit.</s>” That is to say: Who does not teach false and pernicious doctrines.—Instead of the word <l>Pestilentiæ,</s> St. Jerome has <l>Derisorum,</s> which according to the proper Hebrew signification means scoffers, or impostors who teach falsehood. The Septuagint have understood the same expression in the sense of pests, or chair of pestilence. These renderings, however, come to much the same sense; for the impious, such as atheists and heretics, are, as is explained by St. Athanasius, St. Augustine, St. Basil, the pest of the world by the false and pernicious doctrines that they teach.
2~The just man wills what God ordains in his law; hence he continually meditates on it.
4~This tree will always preserve its leaves, which will help to ripen the fruit; thus will all the works of the just man prosper.
5~“<l>Pulvis.</s>” Pagnini translates the Hebrew word by <l>Gluma:</s> chaff, light straw or husks that are separated from the seed by threshing, winnowing, etc.
6~“<l>Non resurgent.</s>” That is, according to the Hebrew text: <l>Non stabunt, non subsistent</s>—they shall not stand, shall not keep their ground; and according to the Chaldee version: <l>Non justificabuntur</s>—they shall not be justified (Bossuet). This means that the wicked at the last judgment will not be able to oppose the just vengeance of Jesus Christ. St. Augustine explains this verse by saying that the wicked will not rise again to be judged because they are already condemned to punishment—<l>Non resurgent ut judicentur, quia jam pœnis destinati sunt.</s> We should, however, here remark that the expression <l>Non resurgent</s> does not mean that the wicked will not rise on the day of judgment; since we read in St. Matthew (25:31-4) that all men, just and sinners, must then rise; and this St. Paul expresses still more clearly in this passage: “We shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ—<l>Omnes enim stabimus ante tribunal Christi</s>” (Rom. 14:10). Moreover, the Apostle himself explains to us how we are to understand the expression, “<l>Non resurgent</s>” of the psalm, when he elsewhere says: “We shall all indeed rise again; but we shall not all be changed—<l>Omnes quidem resurgemus, sed non omnes immutabimur</s>” (1 Cor. 15:51). He wishes thereby to say that all men will rise again, but all will not obtain the happiness of having a spiritual and heavenly body, such as the just will receive, according to what he had written just before in verses 44-49: “It is sown a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body. ...Therefore, as we have borne the image of the earthy, let us also bear the image of the heavenly—<l>Seminatur corpus animale, surget corpus spirituale. ... Igitur, sicut portavimus imaginem terreni, portemus et imaginem caelestis.</s>” The words <l>Non resurgent,</s> thus understood, agree well with the Hebrew text and with the Chaldee version, so that the verses “The wicked shall not rise again in judgment, nor sinners in the council of the just,” may easily be explained in this sense: that the wicked, as the dust or fine chaff or light straw which the wind carries away, will be separated from the just, who are the good grain, according to what we read in the Gospel: “Gather up first the cockle ... to burn, but the wheat gather ye into my barn. The angels shall go out and shall separate the wicked from among the just—<l>Colligite primum zizania ... ad comburendum; triticum ante in congregate in horreum meum. Exibunt Angeli, et separabunt malos de medio justorum</s>” (Matt. 13:30,49).
7~“<l>Novit.</s>” That is to say, approves and blesses. <l>Peribit,</s> shall end in ruin.
