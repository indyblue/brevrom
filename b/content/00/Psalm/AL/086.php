0~This psalm is consecrated to the praise of Jerusalem, this glorious city that God had chosen for his dwelling-place. And since Jerusalem is a figure of the Church, the Fathers and the interpreters refer unanimously this psalm to the Catholic Church; built upon the holy mountains, that is, upon the apostles, as St. Jerome, St. Augustine, Theodoret, Euthymius, explain, and as one may infer from these words of St. Paul: <l>Superædificati super fundamentum Apostolorum.</s> Built upon the foundation of the Apostles (Eph. 2:20). This psalm is as obscure as it is short.
1~“<l>Fundamenta ejus.</s>” That is, according to Bellarmine, Mattei, and others: The foundations of the holy city which I contemplate in spirit. “<l>In montibus sanctis.</s>” On the mountains of Sion and Moria, where the Temple is built; hence St. Jerome translates: <l>In montibus sanctuarii.</s> “<l>Portas Sion.</s>” That is to say: The city of Jerusalem. “<l>Tabernacula Jacob.</s>” The habitation of Jacob, that is, according to Menochius, Bossuet, Mattei, Rotigni, etc. : The other cities of Judea.
2~“<l>Gloriosa dicta sunt.</s>” Many glorious things have been said by the prophets; thus, Menochius, Mariana, and Tirinus.
3~God here speaks. “<l>Rahab.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Superbi;</s> but the interpreters, following the Chaldee, commonly understand Egypt. “<l>Scientium me.</s>” The inhabitants of which shall one day know me through the faith, and shall adore me. It is thus explained by Menochius, Lallemant, and several others.
4~“<l>Alienigenæ.</s>” The Philistines. So it is understood by Lallemant, Mariana, and all the interpreters. “<l>Fuerunt.</s>” This past tense expresses here the future: All the people will be there. This is a prophecy that has been well verified in the Church of Jesus Christ by the conversion of the Gentiles, as Mattei observes.
5~This verse is more obscure than the others. “<l>Numquid Sion dicet.</s>” In this phrase Sion is not in the nominative case. St. Jerome translates: <l>Ad Sion autem dicetur;</s> Estius with Symmachus has: <l>De Sion autem dicetur;</s> and Pagnini: <l>Et ipsi Sion dicetur.</s> “<l>Homo et homo.</s>” A Hebraism, which, as Mattei says, can have two senses: it can signify the multiplicity of men, and so it is understood by Lallemant, or the excellence of man, a wise man, a powerful man, etc., as St. Augustine, St. Jerome, Theodoret, Tertullian, and Bellarmine, and others understand it. Hence the verse is explained thus: What! Is there then no one there to say to Sion, that is to Jerusalem, that in the midst of her will be born a Man the most excelling, who will be the Most High, at once God and man, becoming man in the city founded by himself? <l>In ea factus est homo, et ipse eam fundavit.</s> Thus St. Augustine expresses it.
6~The Lord will announce it, that is, will make it known in Holy Scriptures written for the instruction of the people, and especially in the writings of the apostles, who are the princes or the heads of the new Church. Thus following the explanation of Menochius, in these Scriptures shall be preserved the names of those distinguished men who have illustrated her.
7~In a word, O city of God! O holy Church! those that shall dwell in thee will all be filled with joy on account of the peace that they shall enjoy.
