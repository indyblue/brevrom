0~David consecrates this chant to giving thanks to God for his benefits, and to praying to him for victory over the Edomites. It must be remarked that this psalm has already been explained, partly: verses 1-5, in Psalm 61:10-14; and for the rest, in Psalm 59:5-13. We shall content ourselves with giving here a succinct explanation.
1~My heart is disposed to write whatever Thou ordainest; in all I will bless Thee, and I will sing Thy praises.
2~“<l>Gloria mea.</s>” My spirit, which loves to praise God. “<l>Exurgam diluculo.</s>” I wish to praise Thee at early morn.
4~I shall say that for all, from earth even to the heavens, is full of Thy mercy and fidelity.
5~“<l>Ut liberentur ...</s>” Psalm 59:5.
6,7~Hear me, O Lord, and let Thy right hand save me. God has declared from his sanctuary that I shall one day have the joy of dividing the country of Sichem, or Samaria, and of measuring the lands of the valley of Tents beyond the Jordan, to distribute them at my will.
8~The names of Galaad, Manasses, and Ephraim designate the provinces occupied by the tribes of Israel, whom David called the strength of his head or crown.
9~It is in the tribe of Juda that my throne is established; and the land of Moab which is abundant, makes me hope fully to satisfy my people.
10~“<l>Alienigenæ.</s>” Strangers.
11~Who will lead me into Edom, to take possession of this country, the capital of which is very strong?
12~Shall it not be Thou, my God, who at first didst repel us? Wilt not Thou Thyself go forth with our troops to give us victory?
13~“<l>Vana salus hominis.</s>” In vain can we hope for help from others.
14~Placing our hopes in God, we shall obtain the victory; he will exterminate our enemies.
