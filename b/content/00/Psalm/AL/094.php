0~Several corrections were made in this psalm by St. Jerome; but the Church, not having introduced them into the invitatory of the Office, it follows that we recite it in the breviary as it was recited according to the ancient version. St. Paul declares (Heb. 3:7, 4:7) that in this psalm everything directly refers to Jesus Christ; and since we understand this psalm as proclaiming God, the Creator, and at the same time the Saviour of the world, it is to him as to our supreme Pastor that the Holy Ghost exhorts us to address our praises, and to hearken to him.
1~“<l>Præoccupemus faciem ejus in confessione.</s>” Before the rising of the sun, let us be found in the presence of the Saviour, to praise him and to confess to him our faults. St. Augustine says: “<l>Est confessio laudantis, confessio gementis.</s>—There is the confession of him who praises, and the confession of him who mourns.”
2~“<l>Omnes deos</s>—All the false gods and all the kings of the earth.” “<l>Altitudines montium</s>—Earthly powers,” according to St. Augustine; that is to say: The Lord regards alike the powerful of the world and the poor whom the world despises; for all are in his power; therefore he does not reject any of his people.
4~“<l>Sicut in exacerbatione...</s>” It must here be remarked that this passage is in the Office, as it was anciently read in the psalm; but it was afterwards corrected, as it is now in the psalter, where we read: “<l>Sicut in irritatione, secundum diem tentationis in deserto, ubi tentaverunt me patres vestri; probaverunt me, et viderunt opera mea.</s>” This version, with which the English translation agrees, better explains the text, of which the sense is as follows: It is God who here speaks to the Hebrews, and he says to them: Harden not your hearts, as you did formerly when you provoked me to anger in the wilderness, where your fathers wished to tempt me, to see whether I was the true God, when in that barren and utterly destitute place they sought for water, bread, and flesh; they found by experience at the sight of my wonderful works that I can do all things according to my own pleasure.
5~“<l>Proximus.</s>” Instead of this word, we read in the corrected version, or the psalter, <l>Offensus;</s> and St. Paul says, <l>Infensus</s> (Heb. 3:10). But it is the same thing, as Du Hamel and Bellarmine remark, if <l>Proximus</s> is put for <l>Proximus ad ulciscendum.</s>—“<l>Semper hi errant corde; ipsi vero non cognoverunt vias meas</s>” They have always a perverse heart; they do not wish to know my righteous judgments.—“<l>Requiem meam.</s>” My rest, that is to say, the land that I promised them.
