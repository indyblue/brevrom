0~David, already so often victorious over his enemies, implores God’s help against the Edomites (2 Kings 8:10); (1 Par. 18). This psalm applies very well to the Church, coming forth victorious amid so many persecutions.
1~O great God! it seems that Thou hast deprived us of Thy protection, since Thou hast let us see ourselves defeated; but, though Thou didst at first show Thyself angry with me, Thou hast in the end had compassion on me.
2~“<l>Sana contritiones ejus, quia commota est.</s>” It now remains for Thy mercy to repair the ruins made by this great shock.
3~Thou hast given proof of chastising us severely; Thou hast made us taste of the bitter wine of compunction (or, according to the Hebrew, of fear), and that in order to see us holily contrite.
4~“<l>Ut fugiant a facie arcus.</s>” In order that they may preserve themselves from the arrows of Thy wrath at the sight of the already bended bow.
5~Thou hast acted in this manner in order to save those that love Thee; hear me, then, and let Thy hand save me.
6~God has declared from his sanctuary that one day I shall have the joy of dividing at my will the country of Sichem or Samaria, and of measuring the plains of the Valley of Tents, beyond the Jordan, to distribute them at my pleasure.
7~I already see under my sway Galaad, Manasses, and Ephraim, which are the strength of my head. Under these names are meant the provinces occupied by the tribes of Israel, which David called the strength of his head, that is, of his crown.
8~“<l>Juda, rex meus.</s>” It is in the tribe of Juda that my throne is established, because God has willed that the kings should be chosen from this tribe. “<l>Moab, olla spei meæ.</s>” The province of Moab, which is abundant as a platter filled with meat, is my hope. That is: I hope to satiate my people with the spoils of the Moabites.
9~“<l>Alienigenæ.</s>” Foreigners.
10~Who will lead me into Edom, and make me master of that kingdom whose capital city is very strong?
11~Will it not be Thou, O Lord! who seemed at first to abandon us! And wilt Thou not Thyself go forth at the head of our troops to make us victorious?
12~“<l>Vana salus hominis.</s>” It is in vain that we can hope for our salvation in human intercourse; Thou must aid us Thyself.
13~In placing our hope in God we shall obtain the victory; he will destroy our enemies.
