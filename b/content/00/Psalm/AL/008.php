0~This psalm is a canticle composed in praise of the power, wisdom, and goodness of God, and especially of his goodness towards man. The multitude of the benefits received from God is therefore the subject of this psalm. Thus it is commonly understood by commentators. Nevertheless there are some who, on the authority of a passage of St. Paul (Heb. 2:9), apply it not without probability to the person of Jesus Christ.
2~“<l>Super cælos.</s>” Above the heavens, since the whole world cannot contain it.
3~“<l>Inimicum et ultorem.</s>” Satan Thy principal enemy, and the avenger of all Thy enemies. Some explain this verse, not according to the Vulgate, which has followed the Septuagint, but according to the Hebrew text, which instead of <l>Perfecisti laudem</s>—Thou hast perfected praise—signifies: <l>Fundasti fortitudinem</s>—Thou hast ordained strength. But be this as it may, we have translated it as is to be seen above: Even the very infants at the breast praise Thee perfectly, and confound Thy enemies. We must not depart from this interpretation, which is conformable to the Vulgate; for Jesus Christ himself rendered it authentic when after his entry into Jerusalem the children were heard to cry out: <l>Hosanna Filio David</s>—Hosanna to the Son of David! When the Pharisees murmured at this praise offered to our Lord, he said to them: “<l>Nunquam legistis, quia; Ex ore infantium et lactentium perfecisti laudem?</s>—Yea, have you never read: Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise?” (Matt. 21:16) We do not read the words: <l>Fundasti fortitudinem</s>—Thou hast ordained strength. Xavier Mattei justly observes that in all the passages of the psalter, or of any other book of the Old Testament, which are cited in the New Testament according to the version of the Septuagint, this version should be regarded as true and incontestable; and that if the Hebrew text differs from it, it should be corrected according to the Septuagint version. He adds that it is temerity to interpret such passages in a sense different from that given to them in the New Testament, excepting only certain passages that the Church has otherwise explained according to the Hebrew text, and that are susceptible of divers literal interpretations.
4,5~That is to say: When I consider the marvels that Thou hast wrought in favor of man, how can I refrain from praising Thee and from crying out: What is man, for whom Thou hast so great mindfulness, and whom Thou dost favor with Thy visit? This agrees with what is said in the Canticle of Zachary: “<l>Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel, quia visitavit, et fecit redemptionem plebis suæ</s>—Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people.” The Son of God comes himself to visit man, to take human flesh, and to redeem him from the slavery of the devil.
6-8~Although Thou hast given to man a nature little less than that of the angels, Thou hast nevertheless subjected to him all other creatures.
9~Repetition of the first verse for the conclusion.
