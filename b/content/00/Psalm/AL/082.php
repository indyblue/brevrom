0~We have in this psalm the prayer that the Jewish people addressed to God, asking him for help against the Ammonites, the Moabites, and other Gentiles, who threatened to ruin the Temple and the holy city. This psalm may be used to pray to the intention of the Church whenever she suffers any special persecution.
1~“<l>Quis similis erit tibi?</s>” Who shall have power to do what Thou canst? “<l>Neque compescaris.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Et non quiescas.</s> Hide not Thy just indignation by keeping silence and peace.
2~“<l>Sonuerunt.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Tumultuati sunt.</s>
3~“<l>Malignaverunt consilium.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Nequiter tractaverunt.</s> “<l>Sanctos tuos.</s>” Those that adore Thee.
4~“<l>Disperdamus eos de gente.</s>” According to Mattei, this is a Hebraism, which means: Let us remove this people from the world.
5~“<l>Testamentum disposuerunt.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Fœdus pepigerunt.</s> “<l>Tabernacula.</s>” That is, the tents or the camp, the troops.
6~“<l>Alienigenæ.</s>” The strangers, or foreigners.
7~“<l>Etenim Assur.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Sed et Assur.</s> And even the host of the Assyrians. “<l>Filiis Lot.</s>” Mattei says that hereby we can only understand the Ammonites, the descendants of Ammon, son of Lot.
8~“<l>Madian.</s>” The Madianites, defeated by Gedeon (Jud. 7:20).
10~Oreb and Zeb, two of the chiefs of the Madianites, were slain by the Hebrews (Jud. 7:25). Zebee and Salmana, their kings, were killed by Gedeon himself (Jud. 8:21).
11~“<l>Hereditate possideamus sanctuarium Dei.</s>” Let us go to take possession of the Sanctuary of God, that is, Jerusalem, as an inheritance that belongs to us.
12~“<l>Pone illos ut rotam.</s>” Lallemant thus interprets these words: Send upon them a spirit of giddiness, to disconcert them. “<l>Sicut stipulam ante faciem venti.</s>” Scatter them as a heap of straw is scattered before the wind. Such is the explanation also given by Mattei.
13~“<l>Flamma comburens montes.</s>” Genebrard and Rotigni understand this of volcanoes, as Vesuvius and Etna, which cause general devastation by the flames they send forth. Bellarmine understands it of the dry grass burning on the mountains; but Lallemant and Mattei interpret it of the lightning that strikes the mountains and sets then on fire.
14~St. Jerome translates: <l>Sic persequere eos in tempestate tua, et in turbine tuo conturba eos</s>—So pursue them with the tempest of Thy vengeance, and confuse them with the whirlwind of Thy wrath.
15~“<l>Quærent nomen tuum.</s>” That is, they will enter into themselves and be converted to Thee. But others more commonly explain it thus: They will ask to know Thy name, that is, Thy power; they will be instructed therein, and they will venerate it.
16~If this is not enough to bring about their conversion, let them remain troubled with continual fear of Thy power all their lives, and let them die in confusion.
17~Let them know that the name of the Lord belongs properly to Thee alone, since Thou alone art King of kings throughout the earth.
