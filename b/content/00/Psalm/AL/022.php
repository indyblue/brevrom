0~The principal end of this psalm is to represent God as a good shepherd who omits nothing, so that in the order of eternal salvation his servants may be abundantly provided with help and spiritual means. The verses 1, 2, 6, and 7 plainly refer to this preeminent benefit, which consists in the partaking of the body and blood of Jesus Christ.
2~He has nourished me near waters that flow in the very place of my pasturage; and when my soul like a silly, wayward sheep, went away from him, he brought it back again to his fold.
4~“<l>In medio umbra mortis.</s>” In the midst of a thousand dangers that seem to me to be the figure of death.
5~The shepherd’s crook and the staff which Thou hast in hand console me; for with the crook Thou correctest me when I go out of the path, and with the staff Thou dost drive away the wolves that seek to devour me. “<l>Virga.</s>” Some commentators understand by this the Blessed Virgin Mary, who was called <l>Virga de radice Jesse</s>—a rod out of the root of Jesse (Is. 11:1), of whom was born Jesus.
6~Thou hast prepared before me a table where I shall take a food that will make me strong against my enemies. By this table we may well understand the altar, where we receive as food the body of Jesus Christ, which renders us strong against all the assaults of hell.
7~“<l>In oleo.</s>” With the unction of Thy grace. “<l>Calix meus inebrians.</s>” The chalice that Thou offerest me contains a wine that holily inebriates him that drinks it, making him forget the world to remember only Thee and Thy love. “<l>Quam præclarus est!</s>” How noble and precious is it!
9~“<l>In longitudinem dierum.</s>” During all eternity.
