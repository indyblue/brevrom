The royal prophet at the same time exposes the reflections that his sins and the vain cares of men suggested to him.

7~“<l>Mensurabiles.</s>” St. Jerome’s translation is: <l>Breves</s>—Short. Measurable, or so short that they are easy to count. “<l>Substantia mea.</s>” My life, according to St. Jerome.
8~It is indeed true that every man who lives here on earth, with all the honors and riches that he possesses, is but mere vanity.

11~“<l>Substantia mea apud te est.</s>” All that I have, all my good, subsists in Thee, and depends on Thee, in whom are all my hopes. According to the Hebrew text: <l>Spes mea apud te est</s>—My hope is with Thee.
