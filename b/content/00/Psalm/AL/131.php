0~King Salomon prays to God to come to dwell in the Temple which is prepared for him, and at the same time to perform the promises that David had received for the benefit of his descendants. It is believed that this psalm was chanted when Salomon had the Ark borne into the Temple which he had built.
2-5~While the Ark was still under the tent, David made to God this vow, which he confirmed with an oath: I promise not to enter my house, nor to give myself any repose, until I have found a place for my Lord, which may be a dwelling worthy of the Lord.
6~“<l>Eam.</s>” That is: The Ark.
7~But now we shall enter with joy his own tabernacle, and we shall adore the Lord in this holy place where he has set his feet, that is, where he has begun to dwell.
8~Arise, then, O Lord! and enter the place of Thy repose, with the Ark of Thy sanctification, that is, the Ark by which Thou hast been so glorified.
9~May Thy priests be invested with justice, that is, with holiness, and all Thy holy ministers serve Thee with gladness.
10~For the love of David, Thy beloved servant, reject not his Son who is Thy Christ.
12~“<l>Testamentum.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Pactum.</s> “<l>Testimonia mea.</s>” My precepts, tokens of my will.
13~If their descendants shall do likewise, they in perpetuity shall sit upon this same throne of Thine.
15~The Lord said: This is, etc.
16~“<l>Viduam ejus benedicens benedicam.</s>” Here I will bless the widow by succoring her abundantly.
17~I will vest with salvation, that is, I will sanctify her priests, and her ministers shall live in joy.
18~Here I will cause the power of David to flourish; for I have prepared for him a lamp, that is, a brilliant posterity.
19~“<l>Sanctificatio mea.</s>” That is: The sacred crown by which I have sanctified him.
