0~This psalm has for its title: <l>Psalmus David cum fugeret a facie Absalonis filii sui</s>—David flying before his son Absalom. It was therefore to David fleeing from the persecutions of the unfortunate Absalom that is commonly applied the literal sense of this psalm. But in the mystical sense, according to St. Jerome, St. Augustine, Bede, Theodoret, and others, David here represents Jesus Christ considered in his Passion and in his resurrection. We would here once more remark on the subject of the enemies from whom the royal prophet endured persecution, that all the psalms when they speak literally are to be understood mystically of all the internal and external enemies, especially of our most powerful and most dangerous enemies, I mean the devils who are plotting against our eternal salvation.
2~They tell me that there is no salvation for me, although I trust in my God. “<l>Ipsi ... Ejus.</s>” According to the Greek, these pronouns are masculine. Striking features of resemblance: David is betrayed by Achitophel, who ends by hanging himself (2 Kings 17:23); Jesus Christ is betrayed by Judas, who ends in the same way. David is persecuted by his own people; Jesus hears the Jews crying out to Pilate: “Away with him, away with him, crucify him. ... We have no king but Caesar.—<l>Tolle, crucifige eum. ... Non habemus regem, nisi Cæsarem</s>” (John 19:15). David hears these words: “There is no salvation for him in his God.—<l>Non est salus ipsi in Deo ejus</s>” Jesus hears these other words: “He trusteth in God; let him now deliver him if he will have him.—<l>Confidit in Deo; liberet nunc, si vult eum</s>” (Matt. 27:43).
3~“<l>Gloria mea, et exaltans caput meum.</s>” That is to say: Thou art the cause of my glory; it is Thou that consolest me: I walked with my head bowed down under the weight of sorrows, and Thou hast now enabled me to lift it up again with joy.
4~“<l>De monte sancto suo.</s>” That is, from his high heaven.
5~This verse means in the midst of persecution I took a tranquil and sweet repose; then I awoke and arose without disquietude, seeing that the Lord had taken me under his protection. These are words that mystically apply to Jesus Christ when he wished to be stretched on the cross and there give up his life, and then wished to rise again from the dead by the power of his divinity.
7~“<l>Percussisti omnes adversaries mihi sine causa.</s>” According to the Hebrew, we translate: <l>Percussisti omnes hostes meos in maxilla.</s> The Septuagint, however, have: <l>Sine causa.</s> Bellarmine thinks that the Septuagint have been able to translate thus, because the Hebrew text, which they used, was more correct than that which we have.
8~“<l>Domini est salus.</s>” According to the Hebrew, it is <l>Domino salus.</s> That is, salvation should be referred to God, and it is only from him that we should hope for it. Salvation is the blessing that the Lord gives to his servants; for to bless on the part of God means to do good.
