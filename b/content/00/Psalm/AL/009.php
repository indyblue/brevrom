0~Among the interpreters there are some that see in this psalm, when taken in the literal sense, David thanking God for having given him the victory over his enemy; and when taken in the spiritual sense, Jesus Christ accomplishing the work of the Redemption, and thus subduing the devil, the great enemy of the human race. Others, whose opinion does not lack probability, regard this psalm as the portrait of the unhappy end of the wicked, who have lived in prosperity, and of the glorious end of the just, who have been living in tribulation.
3~“<l>Infirmabuntur.</s>” My principal enemy having been conquered, all those that follow him will be weakened and thrown into consternation.
6~“<l>Inimici.</s>” This word, as Menochius and Mattei observe, is in the genitive; hence the phrase is thus construed: <l>Frameæ inimici defecerunt in finem</s>—The arms of the enemy have entirely failed.
7~“<l>Cum sonitu.</s>” According to Bossuet: <l>Cum ingente rerum gestarum fama</s>—With the mighty fame of their deeds.
8~“<l>In judicio.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Ad judicium.</s>
10~Therefore they that know and adore Thy name have great reason to trust in Thee, O Lord! because Thou hast never forsaken those that seek Thee in truth.
11~Praise the Lord who dwells in Sion, where he is adored as true God, differently from the idols that are found in the temples of the Gentiles; publish his works even among the most barbarous nations, that they too may praise him.
12~In examining the unjust deeds of men, he remembered the blood of the poor and their lamentations.
13~Here David turns to God in prayer.
14~“<l>De portis mortis.</s>” The perils of death. “<l>Filiæ Sion.</s>” That is to say, Jerusalem.
15~I will rejoice in the salvation that Thou hast given me, since my enemies have fallen into the abyss of death, which they had prepared for me. “<l>In interitu.</s>” According to the Hebrew, <l>In fovea,</s> to which the word <l>Infixa</s> corresponds; and this signifies, according to Menochius: They are fallen into the mire, from which it is very difficult further to extricate themselves.
16~“<l>Quem absconderunt.</s>” Which they had secretly laid to catch me.
17~The Lord shall make himself known as the great God that he is, by exercising his just vengeance upon his enemies, and causing the sinner to be caught in the same toils that his hands had laid for others.
18~Malvenda thus interprets this passage: “<l>Convertantur in infernum; quasi dicat: Male peribunt</s>—They shall be turned into hell; as if he said: They shall perish miserably.” According to Menochius by the word <l>Infernum</s> we must understand hell, properly so called, the place destined for the punishment of the wicked: “<l>Non enim sepulchrum tantum significatur hoc loco, nomine Inferni, sed etiam pœnarum locus</s>—By the word hell, in this passage, not only is meant the grave, but also the place of punishment.” This is also the opinion of Gordona. Hence this is the sense of the verse: Those that forget God during their life, will make a bad death, and will be sent to hell.
19~“<l>Non peribit in finem.</s>” The patience of the poor shall not utterly perish; that is, shall not always remain without recompense.
20~O Lord! show Thy power; let not sinful man prevail; let the nations be judged before Thee according to their merit.
21~Give them a legislator who by the severity of his punishments will curb and subdue them, that so they may know that they are men, that is, weak and mortal, obliged to obey Thee.
22~“<l>Despicis in opportunitatibus.</s>” Why dost Thou appear to despise me, by not consoling me when I needed Thy help? (See verse 9.)
23~The proud man boasts in vain of his prosperity, and the poor man complains in vain of his misery.
25~The wicked man has irritated God, and he should become reconciled to God; but blinded by an excess of anger or of pride he will not seek to appease him.
26~“<l>Inquinatæ sunt viæ illius in omni tempore.</s>” All the actions of his life are always stained with sin.
27~He no longer thinks, O Lord! of Thy judgments, that is, of Thy precepts, nor of the punishments with which Thou threatenest him; therefore he seeks to lord it over, that is, to oppress his enemies.
28~“<l>Sine malo.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Ero sine malo</s>—I shall be without evil.
29~“<l>Sub lingua ejus labor et dolor.</s>” His tongue serves only to bring sorrow and distress upon others.
31~“<l>Quasi leo in spelunca sua.</s>” As a lion that lies in ambush in his cave, to seize and devour those that are passing by.

38~“<l>Orphano.</s>” Those that are destitute of all help.
39~“<l>Brachium.</s>” Power. “<l>Quæretur peccatum illius, et non invenietur.</s>” According to St. Augustine: <l>Judicabitur de peccato suo, et ipse peribit propter peccatum suum</s>—He shall be judged for his sin, and he shall be lost on account of his sin. This interpretation seems to agree with what is said in the following verse: <l>Peribitis, gentes, de terra illius</s>—Ye Gentiles shall perish from his land. Hence the sinner shall be judged according to his iniquity, and he shall no longer be found, because he will be forever lost.
41~God will always hear the desire of the just who are afflicted; he will even hearken to the preparation of their heart; that is, the interior disposition that precedes their prayers.
42~“<l>Ut non apponat ultra magnificare se homo super terram.</s>” In order that men on earth may not continue to exalt themselves, that is to say, may not grow proud by exalting themselves against Thee and against their neighbor.
