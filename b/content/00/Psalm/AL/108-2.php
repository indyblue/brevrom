vv. 13-20
<l>"Iniquitas patrum ejus"</s> The iniquity of the fathers of this same people, to be punished in him, as St. Augustine explains, applying the text of the Gospel : <l>Ut veniat super vos omnis sanguis Justus, qui effusus est super terram, a sanguine Abel...</s> That upon you may come all the just blood that hath been shed upon the earth from the blood of Abel... (Matt 23:33). <l>"Matris ejus."</s> By this the holy Doctor understands Jerusalem.
<l>"Fiant contra Dominum semper."</s> May the iniquity of their fathers and the sin of their mother, with their own crimes, be always before the eyes of God in punishment. 
<l>"Hominem inopem..."</s> Jesus Christ himself, who was thus treated without pity. 
<l>"Dilexit maledictionem"</s> St. Augustine applies this to the time when the Jewish people cried out : <l>Sanguis ejus super nos et super filios nostros</s>—His blood be upon us and upon our children (Matt, 27:25).
That is, as St. Augustine explains: May cursing wrap round his body and penetrate within his soul. 

<l>"Hoc opus"</s> St. Jerome translates: <l>Hæc est retributio</s>—This is the punishment.
<l>"Propter nomen tuum"</s> For the glory of Thy name.  <l>"Suavis"</s> St. Jerome translates : <l>Bona.</s> Bent on helping the afflicted.
