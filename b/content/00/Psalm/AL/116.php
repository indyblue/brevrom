0~This psalm invites all the people to praise the mercy and the faithfulness of the Lord for having united them all in one and the same Church. It is thus that the Apostle interprets this psalm in his Epistle to the Romans (15:8-11).
2~That is: He has multiplied upon us the effects of his mercy; and his faithfulness in the promises that he has made to us shall never fail.
