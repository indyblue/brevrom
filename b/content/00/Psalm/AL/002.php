0~This psalm taken in its literal sense is entirely a prophecy of the reign of Jesus Christ, as the Apostles themselves teach us in the fourth chapter of the Acts: “<l>Domine, ... qui, Spiritu Sancto, per os patris nostri David, pueri tui, dixisti: Quare fremuerunt gentes, et populi meditati sunt inania? Astiterunt reges terra, et principes convenerunt in unum, adversus Dominum, et adversus Christum ejus ...</s> Lord, who by the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of our father David, thy servant, hath said: Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people meditate vain things: The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes assembled together against the Lord, and against His Christ” (Acts 4:24). They then continue to speak of the conspiracies that were formed against Jesus Christ by Herod and Pilate in union with the Gentiles and the Jews. In fact, certain Protestant interpreters, and even some Catholic commentators, wish that this psalm should be understood, in a literal sense, of the reign of David. But D. Xavier Mattei wisely observes that this is a novel opinion, prevailing among Protestants, and worthy of our condemnation, since we should hold to the interpretation given by holy Scripture in the Acts of the Apostles; the more so since to apply this psalm to David we must do too great violence to the text, the expression of which so clearly refers to the reign of Jesus Christ. To which Xavier Mattei, conformably to the principles laid down in the preface of his work, adds that sometimes holy Scripture has for its literal sense only the spiritual sense, without supporting any other hidden sense. Consequently, he says, when according to the interpretation of the Apostles this psalm offers so evident a prophecy of the reign of Jesus Christ, what reason is there to apply it to the reign of David? “What rashness,” says St. Jerome, “to look for the sense of this psalm after St. Peter himself has given it to us! what boldness to dare to contradict what he says in the Acts of the Apostles!—<l>Audacia est hunc psalmum interpretari velle post Petrum; imo de eo sentire aliud quam in Actibus apostolorum dixerit Petrus.</s>” Bellarmine also says: “To seek in this psalm a literal sense applicable to David appears to me to be the height of error—<l>Omnino errare videntur qui ad litteram de Davide hunc psalmum explicare nituntur.</s>”
1~This verse predicts that it will be in vain that so many enemies conspire against the Messias. St. Jerome translates the words <l>Fremuerunt</s> and <l>Meditati sunt</s> in the future tense; but Bellarmine rightly says that here the version of the Vulgate, which agrees with the Septuagint, should be preferred; for in the Acts of the Apostles, as we have seen, the two verbs are in the past tense. The words “<l>Meditati sunt inania</s>—they have devised vain things,” are used, because these enemies while endeavoring to destroy the kingdom of Christ only cooperated in its establishment.
2~“<l>Reges ... et principes.</s>” By these kings and princes are meant not only Herod, Pilate, and the chief priests of the Jews, but also all the emperors and all the kings of the Gentiles who have persecuted the Church of Jesus Christ. “<l>Adversus Dominum, et adversus Christum ejus.</s>” The prophet intimates thereby that the enemies in persecuting Christ have also made war against God; for the Messias, by his miracles had proved that he was the Son of God. As to the first word of the verse, “<l>Astiterunt,</s>” according to the sense of the Hebrew text, it is properly to be understood of the counsel that the Jews took among themselves to compass the arrest and the death of Jesus Christ.
3~David makes the enemies of God and of Christ speak here. They say: Let us free ourselves from their rule and their laws. “<l>Jugum.</s>” Instead <l>jugum ipsorum</s>—their yoke, St. Jerome has <l>laqueos eorum</s>—their snares. The wicked hate the laws of God; they regard them only as a yoke, and as insupportable chains.
4~David announces that God will dissipate and confound all the plots of his enemies, and will turn their designs to ridicule. This was accomplished by the destruction of idolatry, the dispersion of the Jews, and the conversion of the Gentiles to the faith.
5~God spoke to the wicked, and confounded them, not by words, but by the terrible punishments that he inflicted on them. “<l>In ira sua, et in furore suo.</s>” We here observe that God never does anything in anger, as men do when they act through passion and with trouble of mind; for the Lord disposes and does everything with moderation and in tranquillity. “Thou judgest with tranquillity—<l>Cum tranquillitate judicas</s>” (Wisd. 12:18). Hence, when one reads in Scripture that God becomes angry, we are to understand that he chastises sinners, not to conduct them to eternal salvation, as he often does in regard to some whom he chastises in order to bring them to repentance, but only that he is chastising them solely to punish them, and to give free course to his justice.
6~“<l>Ego autem constitutus sum Rex ab eo super Sion, montem sanctum ejus.</s>” Here it is Jesus Christ that speaks; he will say to them: I have been made king, not by men, but by God, my Father, over his holy mountain of Sion; that is to say, over his Church, which, as St. Augustine says, was prefigured by the city of Jerusalem, of which Mount Sion was the principal part, and most beloved by God. “<l>Prædicans præceptum ejus.</s>” This means: I have been appointed king that I might publish his commandment. According to the Hebrew we here read: <l>Narrabo ad decretum</s>—I will declare for a decree. Substantially, the words <l>Præceptum</s> and <l>Decretum</s> signify the same thing; namely, the decree whereby God established the kingdom of Jesus Christ to be propagated throughout the world. The terms of the decree are as follows (see verse 7):
7~“<l>Filius meus es tu, ego hodie genui te.</s>” The literal sense of this word of the eternal Father, in the mind of the Holy Ghost, is threefold, as Cardinal Bellarmine and Menochius well remark. The first sense is that of the eternal generation of Jesus Christ as the Word and the eternal Son of God, according to what St. Paul writes: “Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they. For to which of the angels hath he said at any time: Thou art My Son, to-day have I begotten Thee?—<l>Tanto melior Angelis effectus, quanto differentius præ illis nomen hereditavit cum enim dixit aliquando Angelorum: Filius meus es tu, ego hodie genui te?</s>” (Heb. 1:4) Hence St. Augustine rightly says that this passage is to be understood literally of the eternal generation by which the Word was from all eternity begotten by the Father, in contradistinction to the angels who are the ministers of God created in time. We read the words: <l>Hodie genui te</s>—To-day have I begotten Thee; “<l>Hodie</s>”—To-day, because eternity is an actual duration, without beginning and without end, as St. Augustine well explains, speaking of this psalm: “In eternity nothing is either past or future, but only the present; because whatever is eternal, always is.—<l>In æternitate, nec præteritum quidquam est, nec futurum, sed præsens tantum; quia, quidquid æternum est, semper est.</s>” Bossuet (Suppl. in Ps. ii. 7) says that it would be difficult to find in the psalms a passage in which Jesus Christ is more expressly affirmed to be the true Son of God. The second literal sense refers to the resurrection of Jesus Christ, according to what we read in the Acts of the Apostles: “And we declare unto you that the promise which was made to our fathers, this same God hath fulfilled to our children, raising up Jesus again, as in the sacred psalm also is written: Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee.—<l>Et nos vobis annuntiamus eam quæ ad patres nostros repromissio facta est: Quoniam hanc Deus adimplevit filiis nostris, resuscitans Jesum, sicut et in Psalmo secundo scriptum est: Filius meus es tu, ego hodie genui te</s>” (Acts 13:32,33). The resurrection is, in fact, a certain regeneration, according to what we read in St. Matthew: “In the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit, etc.—<l>In regeneratione cum sederit Filius hominis</s>” etc. (Matt. 19:28) The third sense, also literal, has reference to the temporal generation of Jesus Christ according to the flesh. Such is the opinion of St. Cyprian (Testim. adv. Jud. l. 2. c 8), and of St. Fulgentius (Contra Arian. resp. 3); this is well confirmed by these words of the Apostle: “So Christ also did not glorify himself that he might be made a high-priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee.—<l>Sic et Christus non semetipsum clarificavit, ut Pontifex fieret; sed qui locutus est ad eum: Filius meus es tu, ego hodie genui te</s>” (Heb. 5:5). In the Introit of the first Mass of Christmas the Church applies the quoted words of this psalm to the mystery of the day. We here add that the holy Fathers understand these words of Isaias: “Who shall declare his generation?—<l>Generationem ejus quis enarrabit?</s>” (Is. 53:8), as referring not only to the divine generation, but also to the human generation of Jesus Christ.
8~The eternal Father continues: Since Thou art my Son by nature, it is just that Thou shouldst have dominion over all the nations and over the whole earth, as Thy inheritance and possession. St. Augustine understands this of the spiritual power that Jesus Christ has over the Church, which through his merits was to be spread through the entire world, according to what our Saviour has himself said: “All power is given to me in heaven and on earth—<l>Data est mihi omnis potestas in cælo et in terra</s>” (Matt. 28:18).
9~This is understood of the power that Jesus Christ has to reward the good and to punish the wicked as easily as the potter can break with a rod of iron his vessels of clay. The rod of iron signifies, moreover, the righteous and inflexible justice of Jesus Christ, which no one can resist.
10~That is to say: You, then, who are kings, and as such exercise the office of judges on earth, understand what is your duty, and learn to perform it well.
11~“<l>Exsultate ei cum tremore.</s>” St. Augustine thus comments on these words: “In rejoicing, that we give thanks; in trembling, lest we fall.—<l>In exsultatione, ut gratias agamus, in tremore, ne cadamus</s>” (In Ps. 1. n. 4). By the word <l>Timore,</s> according to the Hebrew, we understand the piety of the children towards their father; that is to say, that filial love with which kings and judges should serve God. The verse may therefore be thus explained: Serve the Lord with filial fear and with joy, hoping for reward if you observe justice, and fearing punishment if you do not observe it.
12~This verse signifies: Accept lovingly the law of God, and observe it, lest he be angry with you if you do not observe it, and lest he permit you to stray from the path of justice.
13~Unhappy those that wound justice and that are the cause why God becomes angry with them and hastens to punish them. Happy, on the contrary, are those that trust in God, because he will give them light and strength which they will need in order not to stray from the right path.
