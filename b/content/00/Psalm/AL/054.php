0~David, persecuted by his son Absalom, and imploring the help of God: such, in the literal sense, is the subject of this psalm. But St. Hilary and St. Jerome apply this psalm to Jesus Christ, betrayed by Judas and persecuted by the Jews. Generally speaking, it may be applied to all the just, persecuted in this life by men or devils.
1~“<l>Intende mihi.</s>” Consider my tribulation.
2~I am afflicted in applying myself to consider my sufferings, and I am troubled at hearing of the persecution that my perverse enemy is plotting against me.
3~My enemies have accused me of crimes that I have not committed; and moved by anger, they seek all means to hurt me.
5~“<l>Contexerunt me tenebræ.</s>” I am encompassed all around with darkness, so that I am unable to see any escape from the dangers that threaten me.
6~In this state I said: Who will give me wings, that like a timid dove, as I am at present, I may be able to fly and seek repose in some secure place?
7~I would take flight if I could, and I should be content to remain in some unknown desert. This is the explanation given by Rotigni and Lallemant.
8~There I would wait for him who has so often delivered me from my great fear of soul, and from the tempest that arose against me.
9~Cast down those that seek to oppress me; confound their tongues, that is, put discord between them, so that their designs become fruitless; for I see their iniquity; I see the whole city in contradiction, that is, all in disorder and confusion.
14~But he that persecutes me, who is he? It is thou, my guide and my friend, who I believed had but one and the same heart with me.
19~At all times, I will publish the mercy of the Lord in assisting me, and I hope that he will ever graciously hearken to my prayers.
20~He will establish me again in my former peace, and will deliver my life from those that approach me to oppress me; for they have come in great numbers against me to cast me down. This is according to the translation of St. Jerome, who has: <l>Multi enim fuerunt adversum me.</s>
21~“<l>Qui est ante sæcula.</s>” He who is the Eternal.
22~The Lord sees that for them there is no change, that is, he sees that they are obstinate, and that they have no fear of God; and for this reason he has already raised his hand to punish them according to their malice.
23~“<l>Contaminaverunt testamentum ejus.</s>” They have violated his covenant. St. Jerome translates: <l>Contaminavit pactum suum,</s> that is, they have broken their given faith. “<l>Divisi sunt ab ira vultus ejus.</s>” But they have been scattered at the sight of the anger which the Lord showed against them. “<l>Appropinquavit cor illius.</s>” The heart of God has drawn near, that is, is set to take on them his just vengeance. Others refer the words <l>cor illius,</s> not to God, but to the rebellious. They say that such a rebel or traitor has one thing on his lips and another in his heart. But, according to Bellarmine, here is signified the heart of God aroused to anger.
24~“<l>Ipsi sunt jacula.</s>” In reality their words are sharp arrows hurled when least expected.
25~But the Lord encourages me to leave to his goodness the care of my salvation, and thus he will take thought to preserve my life; he will not permit that the just man should always be tossed about on the billows of fear.
26~On the contrary, O Lord! as for my enemies, Thou wilt cast them down into the pit of death, that is, into hell, where has to be endured a never-ending death. Hell is called a pit, because it has a mouth to receive the damned, but has no door by which they can go out.
