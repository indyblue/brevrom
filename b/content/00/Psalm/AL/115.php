0~This psalm does not differ from the preceding; but in it David shows yet more his gratitude for the graces which he acknowledges that he has received from his goodness.
1~This verse is clearly explained by St. Paul: <l>Habentes autem eundem spiritum fidei, sicut scriptum est: Credidi propter quod locutus sum; et nos credimus, propter quod et loquimur</s>—But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written: I believe, for which cause I have spoken: we also believe, for which cause we speak also (2 Cor. 4:13.) Hence this explanation: Resting on faith I have hoped in God; and I therefore said: Thou art my hope; and this I said on beholding myself so deeply humiliated and afflicted.
2~The following is the explanation given by Bellarmine, with Euthymius: In my ecstasy when my spirit was raised to the knowledge of the land of the living, I said that every man is a liar, that is, that when men talk of this world’s happiness they only speak lies.
4~By the chalice of salvation St. Basil, St. Jerome, St. Augustine, Theodoret, and Euthymius, according to Bellarmine, understand the chalice of the Passion of Jesus Christ, of which he himself spoke thus: <l>Calicem quem dedit mihi Pater, non bibam illum?</s>—The chalice which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? (John 18:11) Hence this explanation: Having nothing to present to God for the graces that he has bestowed upon us, I will offer him in thanksgiving the sufferings of Jesus Christ, to which I will unite those that I endure; and I will always invoke the name of the Lord, that he may enable me to bear my pains with patience.
6~“<l>Quia ego servus tuus.</s>” That is: I will pay my vows to Thee, for I am Thy servant.
