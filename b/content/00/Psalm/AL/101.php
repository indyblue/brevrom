0~In this psalm, which is one of the seven penitential psalms, we see one humbling himself before God, praying for himself and for all the people. According to St. Augustine, it is Jesus Christ who prays for us; in fact, it cannot be denied that in certain verses the Messias and his coming are spoken of.
4~“<l>Cremium.</s>” Du Hamel says: <l>Cremium est id omne quod facile crematur</s>—Whatever easily burns.
5~Interpretation: My heart has been stricken as grass by Thy hand, and my spirit has remained in aridity so that I have forgotten to take my food.
7~“<l>Pelicano.</s>” The pelican loves solitude. According to Mattei, this bird is said to exist, but in reality no one has any knowledge of it. “<l>Nycticorax.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Bubo</s>—the owl which makes its dwelling in ruins and deserted places. “<l>Domicilio.</s>” Mariana says: <l>Vox hebræa ruinas vel parrietinas significant</s>—The Hebrew word signifies ruins or crumbling walls.
8~I have passed whole nights without sleep under the pressure of my woes, and I am become like a solitary sparrow which complains upon the roof, that is, sadness keeps me to within the most retired parts of my house.
9~“<l>Jurabant.</s>” According to Du Hamel: <l>Conjurabant</s>—Conspired together.
10~“<l>Cinerem tamquam panem manducabam.</s>” The bread that I ate seemed to me insipid as ashes.

13~“<l>In æternum permanes.</s>” That is: Thou art, and Thou wilt always be the same. “<l>Memoriale tuum.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Memoria tua.</s> Mattei says that the Hebrew may be so translated; and Menochius explains it thus: <l>Tui memoria, et mentio, et laus</s>—The memory, the mention, and the praise of Thee.
14~“<l>Exsurgens.</s>” That is: As if rising from a profound sleep. “<l>Tempus.</s>” The time fixed in Thy decrees.
15~Mariana says that here is meant the city of Jerusalem, when it was destroyed by its enemies. “<l>Lapides ejus.</s>” The heaps of stones, which is all that is left of the city. “<l>Terræ ejus.</s>” The Hebrew, according to Menochius, Bossuet, and Mattei, here signifies <l>Pulveris ejus</s>—The dust of its ruins.

21~“<l>Filios interemptorum.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Filios mortis.</s> Mattei observes that these two versions according to the Hebrew expression signify the same thing, namely: Those doomed to death; that is, men deprived of the grace before the Redemption.
23~“<l>In unum.</s>” In one church, in one same faith. Du Hamel thus comments: <l>Hæc ad Ecclesiam sub Christo referuntur.</s> Bellarmine, Malvenda, Mariana, and Menochius say the same.
24~Bellarmine and Mattei say that this verse is very obscure, as indeed it is. “<l>Respondit ei.</s>” Bellarmine thinks that it is the psalmist who answers God in regard to what the Lord ordained in verse 19. “<l>In via virtutis suæ.</s>” That is: In the time of the vigor of his age. “<l>Paucitatem dierum meorum nuntia mihi.</s>” O Lord, make me know the shortness of my days, that is, according to the interpreters, if my life shall be too short for me to see the end of these evils on the day of man’s redemption.
25~“<l>Ne revoces me.</s>” St. Jerome translates: <l>Ne rapias me:</s> For mercy’s sake, do not withdraw me from the world. “<l>In generationem et generationem anni tui.</s>” Thou whose years are eternal, canst add to the number of my years.
