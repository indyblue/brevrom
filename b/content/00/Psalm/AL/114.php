0~In this psalm David thanks God for having delivered him from the persecution of Absalom. The royal prophet is here the figure of the Christian soul, which, after suffering many dangerous temptations, finds itself at the approach of death victorious over its enemies and on the point of going to heaven to enjoy its God.
1~I have loved and love my Lord; for he has heard, and I hope will always hear my prayer.
2~He has inclined his ear to my voice; therefore I will never cease to call upon him all the days of my life, confiding in his mercy.
3~Lallemant and Mattei explains this verse as referring to the fears and dangers of losing the life of the body; but Bellarmine interprets it thus: Deadly temptations have surrounded me which would draw me to eternal death, and these temptations have brought me near to the danger of being condemned to hell.
4,5~In this state I found nothing on all sides but afflictions and sorrows; then I had recourse to the Lord, and called upon his name, saying: My God, deliver my soul from these perils. The Lord is as merciful as he is just; he is our God, and he shows mercy to those that have recourse to him.
6~“<l>Parvulos.</s>” The little ones who are humble.
7~“<l>In requiem tuam.</s>” To the place of thy repose, that is, to the heavenly country, as Bellarmine with St. Basil understand it. “<l>Benefecit tibi.</s>” According to the Hebrew: <l>Retribuit super te</s>—The Lord will recompense thee according to thy good works, by giving thee eternal life, which is a crown of justice. Thus again Bellarmine with St. Basil interprets the words.
9~I hope, then, to find myself in the land of the living, far from hell, where all are dead, and far from this world, where so many are also dead through sin, and there I shall be happy, occupied forever in pleasing the Lord.
