0~The prophet describes in this psalm the character of the just man and his temporal happiness which he enjoys here below, according to the promises that God made in the Old Law. But we, who love in the New Law, should raise ourselves to the thought of the spiritual happiness that God makes the just taste in this life and in the next.
1~He that fears God as he ought, that is, with a fear not servile but filial, takes all his delight in observing his precepts. St. Jerome says: <l>Anxie mandata ejus non facit, sed vult:</s> The just man obeys not by force, but with a good will, and loves to obey.
3~His house shall enjoy honors and riches; and with all his honors and riches he will firmly persevere in his holy life, and will not regret at leaving them, because the reward due to his justice shall be everlasting in the life to come.
4~The light that comes from the Lord shall not fail the righteous in the darkness of their afflictions; for God will come to their aid, since he is full of mercy and goodness, and a just rewarder of his servants.
5~“<l>Jucundus.</s>” Mattei says that according to the Hebrew this word signifies <l>Beatus.</s> Happy is the man that exercises mercy towards the poor, at least in lending them what they need; he will regulate his words and his temporal affairs, or will manage his possessions “<l>in judicio,</s>” with prudence, so that he will never be disturbed in his happiness.
6~The just man shall live forever in the memory of men, and he will not fear to lose his character by the calumnies of his enemies.
8~He has given generously of his goods to the poor; his justice, that is, his good deeds, his merits, shall ever be before the eyes of God, to be recompensed eternally in heaven, and he shall be exalted in power and in glory.
9~At seeing this the sinner will be angry; he will gnash with his teeth for rage, and pine away with spite and envy; he would wish to deprive the just man of his happiness, but the desires of the wicked shall vanish as smoke.
