0~Forced to fly from Saul, David is full of sadness in finding himself far from the Tabernacle; he consoles himself with the hope of seeing it again; at the same time he fosters the desire of enjoying the sight of God in the Temple of Heaven after his exile upon earth. This should be the desire of every Christian living in this world at a distance from his heavenly country. He should desire without ceasing for the moment when he can go to see face to face the God of his love.
2~“<l>Deum fortem.</s>” The God Almighty. “<l>Vivum.</s>” The living God, very different from the gods of the Gentiles, who are dead gods.
3~“<l>Dum dicitur mihi quotidie: Ubi est Dens tuus!</s>” As I hear my enemies continually saying to me in my affliction: Where then is now thy God, in whom thou so much hopest to console thee?
4~I remembered these reproaches, and I poured out my soul, that is to say, I emptied or stripped it of all earthly affections, with the sweet thought that I should one day pass from this exile to the admirable tabernacle in which God has established his abode.
5~“<l>Sonus epulantis.</s>” Then I shall take part in the banquet of the blessed, whose voice resounds with the ceaseless songs of joy and thanksgiving.
7~Have confidence in God; for with his help I hope to go one day to heaven, there to celebrate his mercy and say to him: Thou art my God and the salvation of my face, that is to say, my Saviour always present to my eyes: Thou causest my face to see Thy face.
8~“<l>Memor ero tui.</s>” To console myself, I will always think of Thee in whatever place I am.
9~One abyss of ills invites another, which pours down upon me with a crash. David speaks here of the tribulations or temptations that came upon him like billows raised by a storm with terrific roaring.
10~All the waters of the heavens and all the floods of trials with which Thou triest Thy servants, seem to have passed over me.
11~In the day time, or at the time of my consolations, the Lord has made me taste of the sweetness of his mercy; but now in this night of tribulations he wills that, resigned to his will, I cease not to sing his praises and to bless him.
12~Therefore my prayer to God, the author and the preserver of my life, shall be continual in my heart; I will always say to him: Lord Thou art my protector, do not abandon me.
13~“<l>Quare oblitus es mei?</s>” But why dost Thou deal with me as if Thou hadst forgotten me?
