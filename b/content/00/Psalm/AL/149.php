1~Sing to the Lord a new canticle for all the new benefits that he has bestowed upon us, and especially for having given us Jesus Christ for our Redeemer: it is just that in the assembly of the saints, that is, of Christians, the praises of the Lord should ever resound.
2~Let the children of the holy Church exult in their God who has created them, and who reigns in them by his grace.
4~“<l>Exultabit mansuetos in salutem.</s>” He will exalt the meek by giving them eternal salvation.
5~“<l>In gloria.</s>” In the glory of heaven, where they shall enjoy eternal gladness.

9~“<l>Ut faciant in eos judicium conscriptum.</s>” So they shall execute upon the persecutors the judgment spoken of in Holy Scripture. <l>Judicabunt nationes, et dominabuntur populis</s>—They shall judge nations, and rule over people (Wis. 3:8).
