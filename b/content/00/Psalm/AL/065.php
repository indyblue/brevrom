0~This psalm is a song of thanksgiving addressed by the people to God for having delivered them from their enemies. It may be applied to the Gentiles delivered from the tyranny of the devil.
2~“<l>Mentientur tibi inimici tui.</s>” The very enemies, at the sight of Thy power, will come to submit themselves to Thy rule, but feignedly: <l>Mentientur.</s>
5~Reference is made to the passage of the Red Sea and the Jordan in the exodus from Egypt.
6~He rules ever over the whole world; he watches over all nations, that the wicked who dare to offend him may not have reason to become proud.
8~“<l>Ad vitam.</s>” That is: <l>Ad vivendum.</s> The sense of this verse is: He has preserved my life, and has not suffered my feet to stumble, or that I should fall over any precipice.
9~Thou hast tried us with tribulations, as silver is tried in the fire.
10~“<l>Imposuisti homines super capita nostra.</s>” Thou hast placed cruel men over us.
12,13~I will go into Thy temple to offer to Thee the sacrifices, and to render to Thee the thanksgivings that I owe Thee, according to the vows that I made to Thee.
14~“<l>Holocausta medullata.</s>” Victims, fat and full of marrow; that is, not only sacrifices of external works, but also of inward affections of the heart. “<l>Cum incenso arietum.</s>” Rams, fragrant with incense.
17~If I had regarded with attachment any iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have heard me.
19~May God be forever blessed, since he has not suffered me to forget to pray to him, because by my praying to him I have obtained his mercy so that he has not removed from me. St. Augustine has written this beautiful maxim: “<l>Cum videres non a te amotam deprecationem tuam. securus esto, quia non est a te amota misericordia ejus</s>—When thou seest that thy prayer is not removed from thee, be sure that neither is his mercy removed from thee.”
