0~A prayer of David when he was in the desert, pursued by his enemies. He thanks God for his protection; and it is in his mercy that he always wishes to hope.
1~At break of day I wake from sleep and come to Thee.
2~My soul has so great thirst for Thee, that my body also feels the ardor.
4~“<l>Labia mea laudabunt te.</s>” My lips shall always be employed in praising Thee.
5~Thus throughout my life I will do nought but bless Thee, and I will lift up my hands continually to invoke Thy name.
6~“<l>Sicut adipe et pinguedine.</s>” As with an agreeable and nourishing fatness, that is, with the abundance of Thy grace and consolations.
7~If in the time of my repose, when in my bed, I was mindful of Thee, much more when day comes will I meditate upon Thy goodness in having thus protected me.
8~“<l>In velamento alarum tuarum.</s>” At seeing that Thou coverest me with Thy wings.
9~It is in vain that my enemies have sought to take my life; they shall lose their own instead, and shall be buried in the abyss of hell; there they shall be given into the hand of the avenging sword of God; they shall become the prey of foxes, that is, of devils who as foxes deceive men by their cunning.
10~“<l>Rex ... in eo.</s>” Some refer these words to David, and believe that there is question here of the oath of fidelity which had to be made to him when he came to the throne. But Rotigni and Lallemant say, with greater probability, that they refer to the Messias, the King of the world and true God; for it is one thing to swear allegiance to a king, and another to swear by the name of a king. This is the meaning of the words: <l>Jurant in eo.</s>
