0~This psalm contains the sighs of the Jews to be released from captivity at Babylon. It is of service to sinners who wish to be delivered from this slavery of sin, and to the just who sigh for the end of their exile here on earth.
1~St. Jerome translates: <l>Cum converteret Dominus captivitatem Sion, facti sumus quasi somniantes.</s> The verse is explained thus: When the Lord shall bring forth Sion, or his people from captivity, we shall be filled with such consolation that we shall seem to be in a dream.
2~Then we shall be so full of joy that our tongue will break forth in canticles of gladness.
4~And we, too, shall say: The Lord hath wrought great things in our behalf; for this reason we rejoice.
5~Deliver us, then, O Lord! from our captivity, and grant that we may be consoled as are consoled those that dwell in the South when there comes to them an abundance of water.
