0~David, seeing himself surrounded by the soldiers of Saul (1 Kings 19:11), invokes the Lord’s assistance and predicts the ruin of his enemies. This psalm applies in every point to Jesus Christ persecuted by the Jews.
2~“<l>De viris sanguinum.</s>” From these cruel men that thirst for my blood.
4~“<l>Neque iniquitas mea, neque peccatum meum.</s>” Thou knowest that there is in me no iniquity, nor any fault with which they can reproach me.
5~Thou seest the peril in which I am; arise to help me, O mighty God, O God of Israel.
6~“<l>Qui operantur iniquitatem.</s>” Who do not wish to cease to be unjust.
7~There are those that thus understand this verse: They will arrive late in the evening; but, like stray dogs, they will suffer great hunger, that is, they will have a great desire to be just in order to find peace; they will go round about the city of God, but they will not find mercy. Others explain it better, thus: They will go and return from morning till evening; they will even surround the city, seeking like dogs to satisfy their hunger, and to oppress the just; but they will be disappointed (see verse 16).
8~Their mouth will speak of nothing else than of laying snares and killing, saying at the same time: Who knows of it?
9~Thou wilt make them an object of ridicule, and wilt destroy all their wicked people.
11~God will make known to me the vengeance that he will take on my enemies. I pray Thee, O Lord! to punish them, but do not destroy them, so that my subjects, having always their chastisement before their eyes, may not forget Thy justice.
12~“<l>Depone eos.</s>” That is: Reduce them to such a state that they may not be able to raise their heads to injure me.
13~Let this be the punishment of their slanderous mouth and of their wicked discourse; may they be taken and confounded in their very pride.
16~In the mean time they continue from morning till night laying snares for the just, to devour them like hungry dogs, and they surround the city, in order that the prey may not be able to escape them (see verse 7).
17~They disperse in different places to devour the just; and if they do not succeed in satiating themselves with their blood, they do not cease at least to take away their good name.
20~Thou art my helper and defender in all my wants; and therefore I will always sing Thy praises, calling Thee my God and my Mercy.
