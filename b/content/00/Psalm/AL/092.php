0~The psalmist exalts the power that God manifested in creating heaven and earth; and transporting himself in thought to the first moment of creation, he represents to himself God, who in some way proceeds from the mystery of his eternal existence, in order to reveal himself in the production of creatures.
1~The Lord has established his kingdom over the whole universe; he has clothed himself with majesty; he has girt himself ready to govern the world and to fill it with his benefits.
3~Lord, thy throne or thy reign was established from all eternity, since Thou hast existed eternally before all creatures.
4,5~The rivers seem to have raised their voice to praise Thee; the sound of many waters has served them for voice to give Thee glory.
6~Marvellous are the heavings of the waves of the sea when agitated by the winds; yet more marvellous is the Lord, who from the height of heaven bridles the rage of the billows, and governs all things.
7~The tokens of Thy goodness and grandeur, which are proclaimed from Thy house, that is, from the Church, are but too clear and evident; it is fitting then that this Thy house should by Thy divine Providence ever be kept holy and pure of all stain.
