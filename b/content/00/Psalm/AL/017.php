6~I have been frightened by the horrors of the tomb, that is to say, with the sadness which he feels who knows that he must soon be carried to the grave; for the snares that my enemies have laid to deprive me of life, have preoccupied me, or have filled my soul with terror.

Commentators give to this image a mystical sense, thus: The Lord, in this present life, does not make his presence sensible; he hides his majesty as in black clouds laden with dark rain; that is to say, from the depth of this obscurity he showers down graces upon his faithful souls.
