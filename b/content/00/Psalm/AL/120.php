0~Here the psalmist makes a just man speak, who lifts his eyes to the blessed mountains, where is seated the holy city, and whence he hopes for divine help.
3~The Lord will not suffer thee to fall, when thou hast recourse to him.
6~Thou wilt not have to fear the burning of the sun, nor the noxious influences of the moon.
8~May he protect thee in all thy doings, from the beginning to the end, now and forever.
