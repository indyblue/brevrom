0~In this psalm the just are exhorted to place confidence in God during the time of persecution.
1~This is a difficult verse; it is thus explained: In the Lord I put my trust; why, then, dost thou come to me and say: Fly to the mountain as a sparrow, to escape the vexations that afflict thee in the place in which thou art? This language is that of the just man who rejects the suggestions of the devil. When the sparrows fear to be taken in the nets of the fowlers, they flee to the mountains, which are the places more safe for them; but the just man, who trusts in God, seeks no change of place; for he knows that there are everywhere temptations of the enemy, and that everywhere God helps him who trusts in him.

6~The Lord puts questions, that is to say, he knows the just man to reward him, and he knows the wicked man to punish him; hence, says the psalmist, he that loves iniquity hates himself, because he draws down upon himself the divine vengeance.
7~The Lord will shower down upon sinners in this life snares by which they shall be involved in greater sins; and in the next life he will rain upon them fire, sulphur, and storms; that is, most painful torments, which will be the portion of their chalice, or their inheritance, their eternal punishment; such shall be the fruit of their sins.
8~“<l>Æquitatem vidit vultus ejus.</s>” He considers the merit of each one, in order to punish the wicked and reward the just according to justice.
