2~“<l>Corrupti sunt.</s>” The wicked say that there is no God; because they are corrupt, first in their will, and then in their understanding. “<l>In studiis suis.</s>” In following their passions.
3~The Lord has looked upon these unfortunate men to see whether any one of them knows God, and seeks him to love and obey him.
5~“<l>Sepulchrum patens.</s>” An open sepulchre, which, filled with corruption, exhales an infectious odor. “<l>Venenum aspidum sub labiis eorum.</s>” They seem to keep beneath their tongue the venom of asps, to defame and outrage others.
7~Miserable that they are! their whole life is but affliction and sadness, because they did not wish to know the way to find peace, which consists in having before one’s eyes the fear of God.
9~Their obstinacy arises from their unwillingness to call upon the Lord for help, so that he may give them his holy fear. They fear to lose the divine grace, which brings with it every good.
11~But say the wicked: Who will come from Sion to save Israel? But know that the Lord shall deliver his people from bondage, and its joy shall be great.
