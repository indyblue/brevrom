0~David bewails his sins. This psalm is suitable for every penitent that looks upon his sufferings and his tribulations as just chastisements of his sins, for which he begs pardon from God.
1~That is to say: Chastise me as a father, not as a judge; chastise me that I may amend, instead of being lost. See what is said in Psalm 2:5 and Psalm 5:1.
2~“<l>Sagittæ tuæ.</s>” Thy arrows, Thy chastisements. “<l>Confirmasti super me manum tuam.</s>” Justly hast Thou pressed heavily Thy hand upon me, loading me with trials.
3~At the sight of Thy anger, I have lost my health of body; and at the sight of my sins, I have lost peace, so that my bones are all trembling.
4~My iniquities are so many that they rise even higher than my head; and so grievous, that they weigh me down as a heavy burden.
5~“<l>A facie insipientiæ meæ.</s>” Because I have neglected to apply a timely remedy.
6~“<l>Curvatus sum usque in finem.</s>” I have remained utterly bent down towards the earth, so that I am scarcely able to raise my eyes to heaven.
7~“<l>Lumbi mei.</s>” That is to say: My concupiscence. “<l>Illusionibus.</s>” According to the Chaldee: <l>Ardore</s>—A malignant heart.
8~I have been so afflicted and cast down, that the groans of my heart to heaven were like to the roarings of a lion.
10~My heart, or my will, has continued in trouble, since all strength has left me; and my eyes, that is, my mind, have lost the light, which made me see the truth.
11~They have drawn near, not to aid me, but to oppress me.
13~“<l>Vanitates.</s>” Falsehoods, calumnies, to destroy me.
17~I said within myself: Ah! may my enemies not have to rejoice over my ruin, since as my feet began to be unsteady, and they saw me tottering and likely to fall, they said great things at my expense, predicting my final overthrow.
18~Lord, I am prepared to suffer all the evils that Thou mayest send me; for my sorrow, that is to say, my sin which is the object of my sorrow, is ever before my eyes.
19~For I know and will always confess my fault; and I will ever think of my sin, that I may satisfy, as far as I can, my offended God, in order to obtain his forgiveness.
20~“<l>Confirmati sunt.</s>” They continue to arm themselves.
