Psalm 105 iii
They provoked him also at the waters of contradiction: * and Moses was afflicted for their sakes: because they exasperated his spirit.
And he distinguished with his lips; * they did not destroy the nations of which the Lord spoke unto them.
And they were mingled among the heathens, and learned their works: and served their idols, * and it became a stumblingblock to them.
And they sacrificed their sons, * and their daughters to devils.
And they shed innocent blood: * the blood of their sons and of their daughters which they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan.
And the land was polluted with blood, and was defiled with their works: * and they went aside after their own inventions.
And the Lord was exceedingly angry with his people: * and he abhorred his inheritance.
And he delivered them into the hands of the nations: * and they that hated them had dominion over them.
And their enemies afflicted them: and they were humbled under their hands: * many times did he deliver them.
But they provoked him with their counsel: * and they were brought low by their iniquities.
And he saw when they were in tribulation: * and he heard their prayer.
And he was mindful of his covenant: * and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
And he gave them unto mercies, * in the sight of all those that had made them captives.
Save us, O Lord, our God: * and gather us from among nations:
That we may give thanks to thy holy name, * and may glory in thy praise.
Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting: * and let all the people say: So be it, so be it.
