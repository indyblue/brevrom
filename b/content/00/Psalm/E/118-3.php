Psalmus 118 iii. Legem pone
~He
Set before me for a law the way of thy justifications, O Lord: * and I will always seek after it.
Give me understanding, and I will search thy law; * and I will keep it with my whole heart.
Lead me into the path of thy commandments; * for this same I have desired.
Incline my heart into thy testimonies * and not to covetousness.
Turn away my eyes that they may not behold vanity: * quicken me in thy way.
Establish thy word to thy servant, * in thy fear.
Turn away my reproach, which I have apprehended: * for thy judgments are delightful.
Behold I have longed after thy precepts: * quicken me in thy justice.
~Vau
Let thy mercy also come upon me, O Lord: * thy salvation according to thy word.
So shall I answer them that reproach me in any thing; * that I have trusted in thy words.
And take not thou the word of truth utterly out of my mouth: * for in thy words, I have hoped exceedingly.
So shall I always keep thy law, * for ever and ever.
And I walked at large: * because I have sought after thy commandments.
And I spoke of thy testimonies before kings: * and I was not ashamed.
I meditated also on thy commandments, * which I loved.
And I lifted up my hands to thy commandments, which I loved: * and I was exercised in thy justifications.
