Psalm 36 ii
Better is a little to the just, * than the great riches of the wicked.
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken in pieces; * but the Lord strengtheneth the just.
The Lord knoweth the days of the undefiled; * and their inheritance shall be for ever.
They shall not be confounded in the evil time; and in the days of famine they shall be filled, * because the wicked shall perish.
And the enemies of the Lord, presently after they shall be honoured and exalted, * shall come to nothing and vanish like smoke.
The sinner shall borrow, and not pay again; * but the just sheweth mercy and shall give.
For such as bless him shall inherit the land: * but such as curse him shall perish.
With the Lord shall the steps of a man be directed, * and he shall like well his way.
When he shall fall he shall not be bruised, * for the Lord putteth his hand under him.
I have been young, and now am old; * and I have not seen the just forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread.
He sheweth mercy, and lendeth all the day long; * and his seed shall be in blessing.
Decline from evil and do good, * and dwell for ever and ever.
For the Lord loveth judgment, and will not forsake his saints: * they shall be preserved for ever.
The unjust shall be punished, * and the seed of the wicked shall perish.
But the just shall inherit the land, * and shall dwell therein for evermore.
