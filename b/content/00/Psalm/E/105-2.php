And they provoked Moses in the camp, * Aaron the holy one of the Lord.
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan: * and covered the congregation of Abiron.
And a fire was kindled in their congregation: * the flame burned the wicked.
They made also a calf in Horeb: * and they adored the graven thing.
And they changed their glory * into the likeness of a calf that eateth grass.
They forgot God, who saved them, * who had done great things in Egypt, wondrous works in the land of Cham: terrible things in the Red Sea.
And he said that he would destroy them: * had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach:
To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them; * and they set at nought the desirable land.
They believed not his word, and they murmured in their tents: * they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord.
And he lifted up his hand over them: * to overthrow them in the desert;
And to cast down their seed among the nations, * and to scatter them in the countries.
They also were initiated to Beelphegor: * and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
And they provoked him with their inventions: * and destruction was multiplied among them.
Then Phinees stood up, and pacified him: * and the slaughter ceased.
And it was reputed to him unto justice, * to generation and generation for evermore.
