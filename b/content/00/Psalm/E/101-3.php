Psalmus 101 iii. Resp√≥ndit ei in via
He answered him in the way of his strength: * Declare unto me the fewness of my days.
Call me not away in the midst of my days: * thy years are unto generation and generation.
In the beginning, O Lord, thou foundedst the earth: * and the heavens are the works of thy hands.
They shall perish but thou remainest: * and all of them shall grow old like a garment:
And as a vesture thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed. * But thou art always the selfsame, and thy years shall not fail.
The children of thy servants shall continue: * and their seed shall be directed for ever.
