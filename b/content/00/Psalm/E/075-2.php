Psalm 75 ii
Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee? * from that time thy wrath.
Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven: * the earth trembled and was still,
When God arose in judgment, * to save all the meek of the earth.
For the thought of man shall give praise to thee: * and the remainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee.
Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your God: * all you that are round about him bring presents.
To him that is terrible, even to him who taketh away the spirit of princes: * to the terrible with the kings of the earth.
