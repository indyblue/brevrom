To thee, O God, I will sing a new canticle: * on the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings I will sing praises to thee.
Who givest salvation to kings: * who hast redeemed thy servant David from the malicious sword: Deliver me,
And rescue me out of the hand of strange children; whose mouth hath spoken vanity: * and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity:
Whose sons are as new plants * in their youth:
Their daughters decked out, * adorned round about after the similitude of a temple:
Their storehouses full, * flowing out of this into that.
Their sheep fruitful in young, abounding in their goings forth: * their oxen fat.
There is no breach of wall, nor passage, * nor crying out in their streets.
They have called the people happy, that hath these things: * but happy is that people whose God is the Lord.
