Psalm 41 ii
My soul is troubled within myself: * therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and Hermoniim, from the little hill.
Deep calleth on deep, * at the noise of thy flood-gates.
All thy heights and thy billows * have passed over me.
In the daytime the Lord hath commanded his mercy; * and a canticle to him in the night.
With me is prayer to the God of my life. * I will say to God: Thou art my support.
Why hast thou forgotten me? * and why go I mourning, whilst my enemy afflicteth me?
Whilst my bones are broken, * my enemies who trouble me have reproached me;
Whilst they say to me day by day: Where is thy God? * Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me?
Hope thou in God, for I will still give praise to him: * the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
