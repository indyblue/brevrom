Psalmus 17 iii. Et ded√≠sti mihi
And thou hast given me the protection of thy salvation: * and thy right hand hath held me up:
And thy discipline hath corrected me unto the end: * and thy discipline, the same shall teach me.
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; * and my feet are not weakened.
I will pursue after my enemies, and overtake them: * and I will not turn again till they are consumed.
I will break them, and they shall not be able to stand: * they shall fall under my feet.
And thou hast girded me with strength unto battle; * and hast subdued under me them that rose up against me.
And thou hast made my enemies turn their back upon me, * and hast destroyed them that hated me.
They cried, but there was none to save them, to the Lord: * but he heard them not.
And I shall beat them as small as the dust before the wind; * I shall bring them to nought, like the dirt in the streets.
Thou wilt deliver me from the contradictions of the people; * thou wilt make me head of the Gentiles.
A people which I knew not, hath served me: * at the hearing of the ear they have obeyed me.
The children that are strangers have lied to me, * strange children have faded away, and have halted from their paths.
The Lord liveth, and blessed be my God, * and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
O God, who avengest me, and subduest the people under me, * my deliverer from my enraged enemies.
And thou wilt lift me up above them that rise up against me: * from the unjust man thou wilt deliver me.
Therefore will I give glory to thee, O Lord, among the nations, * and I will sing a psalm to thy name.
Giving great deliverance to his king, and shewing mercy to David, his anointed: * and to his seed for ever.
