Psalmus 43 iii. Si oblíti sumus
If we have forgotten the name of our God, * and if we have spread forth our hands to a strange god:
Shall not God search out these things: * for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
Because for thy sake we are killed all the day long: * we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
Arise, why sleepest thou, O Lord? * arise, and cast us not off to the end.
Why turnest thou thy face away? * and forgettest our want and our trouble?
For our soul is humbled down to the dust: * our belly cleaveth to the earth.
Arise, O Lord, help us * and redeem us for thy name’s sake.
