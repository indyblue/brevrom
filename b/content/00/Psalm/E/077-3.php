And they added yet more sin against him: * they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water.
And they tempted God in their hearts, * by asking meat for their desires.
And they spoke ill of God: * they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, * and the streams overflowed.
Can he also give bread, * or provide a table for his people?
Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: * and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel.
Because they believed not in God: * and trusted not in his salvation.
And he had commanded the clouds from above, * and had opened the doors of heaven.
And had rained down manna upon them to eat, * and had given them the bread of heaven.
Man ate the bread of angels: * he sent them provisions in abundance.
He removed the south wind from heaven: * and by his power brought in the southwest wind.
And he rained upon them flesh as dust: * and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.
And they fell in the midst of their camp, * round about their pavilions.
So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire: * they were not defrauded of that which they craved.
As yet their meat was in their mouth: * and the wrath of God came upon them.
And he slew the fat ones amongst them, * and brought down the chosen men of Israel.
