Psalm 24 i
To thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul: * in thee, O my God, I put my trust; let me not be ashamed.
Neither let my enemies laugh at me: * for none of them that wait on thee shall be confounded.
Let all them be confounded that act unjust things * without cause.
Shew, O Lord, thy ways to me, * and teach me thy paths.
Direct me in thy truth, and teach me; * for thou art God my Saviour; and on thee have I waited all the day long.
Remember, O Lord, thy bowels of compassion; * and thy mercies that are from the beginning of the world.
The sins of my youth * and my ignorances do not remember.
According to thy mercy remember thou me: * for thy goodnessâ€™ sake, O Lord.
