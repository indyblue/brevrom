How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach: * is the adversary to provoke thy name for ever?
Why dost thou turn away thy hand: and thy right hand * out of the midst of thy bosom for ever?
But God is our king before ages: * he hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.
Thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm: * thou didst crush the heads of the dragons in the waters.
Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon: * thou hast given him to be meat for the people of the Ethiopians.
Thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents: * thou hast dried up the Ethan rivers.
Thine is the day, and thine is the night: * thou hast made the morning light and the sun.
Thou hast made all the borders of the earth: * the summer and the spring were formed by thee.
