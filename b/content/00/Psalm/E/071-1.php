Psalmus 71 i. Deus, judícium tuum
Give to the king thy judgment, O God: * and to the king’s son thy justice:
To judge thy people with justice, * and thy poor with judgment.
Let the mountains receive peace for the people: * and the hills justice.
He shall judge the poor of the people, and he shall save the children of the poor: * and he shall humble the oppressor.
And he shall continue with the sun, and before the moon, * throughout all generations.
He shall come down like rain upon the fleece; * and as showers falling gently upon the earth.
In his days shall justice spring up, and abundance of peace, * till the moon be taken away.
And he shall rule from sea to sea, * and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
