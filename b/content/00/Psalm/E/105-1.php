Psalmus 105 i. Confitémini Dómino
Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: * for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who shall declare the powers of the Lord? * who shall set forth all his praises?
Blessed are they that keep judgment, * and do justice at all times.
Remember us, O Lord, in the favour of thy people: * visit us with thy salvation.
That we may see the good of thy chosen, that we may rejoice in the joy of thy nation: * that thou mayst be praised with thy inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers: * we have acted unjustly, we have wrought iniquity.
Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt: * they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies:
And they provoked to wrath going up to the sea, * even the Red Sea.
And he saved them for his own name&apos;s sake: * that he might make his power known.
And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up: * and he led them through the depths, as in a wilderness.
And he saved them from the hand of them that hated them: * and he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
And the water covered them that afflicted them: * there was not one of them left.
And they believed his words: * and they sang his praises.
They had quickly done, they forgot his works: * and they waited not for his counsels.
And they coveted their desire in the desert: * and they tempted God in the place without water.
And he gave them their request: * and sent fulness into their souls.
