When Israel went out of Egypt, * the house of Jacob from a barbarous people:
Judea was made his sanctuary, * Israel his dominion.
The sea saw and fled: * Jordan was turned back.
The mountains skipped like rams, * and the hills like the lambs of the flock.
What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee: * and thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, * and ye hills, like lambs of the flock?
At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved, * at the presence of the God of Jacob:
Who turned the rock into pools of water, * and the stony hill into fountains of waters.
Not to us, O Lord, not to us; * but to thy name give glory.
For thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake: * lest the Gentiles should say: Where is their God?
But our God is in heaven: * he hath done all things whatsoever he would.
The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold, * the works of the hands of men.
They have mouths and speak not: * they have eyes and see not.
They have ears and hear not: * they have noses and smell not.
They have hands and feel not: they have feet and walk not: * neither shall they cry out through their throat.
Let them that make them become like unto them: * and all such as trust in them.
The house of Israel hath hoped in the Lord: * he is their helper and their protector.
The house of Aaron hath hoped in the Lord: * he is their helper and their protector.
They that fear the Lord have hoped in the Lord: * he is their helper and their protector.
The Lord hath been mindful of us, * and hath blessed us.
He hath blessed the house of Israel: * he hath blessed the house of Aaron.
He hath blessed all that fear the Lord, * both little and great.
May the Lord add blessings upon you: * upon you, and upon your children.
Blessed be you of the Lord, * who made heaven and earth.
The heaven of heaven is the Lord’s: * but the earth he has given to the children of men.
The dead shall not praise thee, O Lord: * nor any of them that go down to hell.
But we that live bless the Lord: * from this time now and for ever.
