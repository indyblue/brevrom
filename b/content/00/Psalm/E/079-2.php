Psalmus 79 ii. Víneam de Ægýpto
Thou hast brought a vineyard out of Egypt: * thou hast cast out the Gentiles and planted it.
Thou wast the guide of its journey in its sight: * thou plantedst the roots thereof, and it filled the land.
The shadow of it covered the hills: * and the branches thereof the cedars of God.
It stretched forth its branches unto the sea, * and its boughs unto the river.
Why hast thou broken down the hedge thereof, * so that all they who pass by the way do pluck it?
The boar out of the wood hath laid it waste: * and a singular wild beast hath devoured it.
Turn again, O God of hosts, * look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vineyard:
And perfect the same which thy right hand hath planted: * and upon the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.
Things set on fire and dug down * shall perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: * and upon the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.
And we depart not from thee, thou shalt quicken us: * and we will call upon thy name.
O Lord God of hosts, convert us: * and shew thy face, and we shall be saved.
