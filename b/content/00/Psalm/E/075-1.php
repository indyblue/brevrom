Psalmus 75 i. Notus in Jud√¶a
In Judea God is known: * his name is great in Israel.
And his place is in peace: * and his abode in Sion:
There hath he broken the powers of bows, * the shield, the sword, and the battle.
Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills. * All the foolish of heart were troubled.
They have slept their sleep; * and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, * they have all slumbered that mounted on horseback.
