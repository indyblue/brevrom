Psalm 39 ii
I have declared thy justice in a great church, * lo, I will not restrain my lips: O Lord, thou knowest it.
I have not hid thy justice within my heart: * I have declared thy truth and thy salvation.
I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth * from a great council.
Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me: * thy mercy and thy truth have always upheld me.
For evils without number have surrounded me; * my iniquities have overtaken me, and I was not able to see.
They are multiplied above the hairs of my head: * and my heart hath forsaken me.
Be pleased, O Lord to deliver me: * look down, O Lord, to help me.
