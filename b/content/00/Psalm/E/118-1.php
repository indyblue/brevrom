~Aleph
Blessed are the undefiled in the way, * who walk in the law of the Lord.
Blessed are they that search his testimonies: * that seek him with their whole heart.
For they that work iniquity, * have not walked in his ways.
Thou hast commanded * thy commandments to be kept most diligently.
O! that my ways may be directed * to keep thy justifications.
Then shall I not be confounded, * when I shall look into all thy commandments.
I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, * when I shall have learned the judgments of thy justice.
I will keep thy justifications: * O! do not thou utterly forsake me.
~BÃ©th
By what doth a young man correct his way? * By observing thy words.
With my whole heart have I sought after thee: * let me not stray from thy commandments.
Thy words have I hidden in my heart, * that I may not sin against thee.
Blessed art thou, O Lord: * teach me thy justifications.
With my lips * I have pronounced all the judgments of thy mouth.
I have been delighted in the way of thy testimonies, * as in all riches.
I will meditate on thy commandments: * and I will consider thy ways.
I will think of thy justifications: * I will not forget thy words.
