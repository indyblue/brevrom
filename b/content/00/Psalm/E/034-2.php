Psalmus 34 ii. Surgéntes testes iníqui
Unjust witnesses rising up * have asked me things I knew not.
They repaid me evil for good: * to the depriving me of my soul.
But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, * I was clothed with haircloth.
I humbled my soul with fasting; * and my prayer shall be turned into my bosom.
As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please: * as one mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.
But they rejoiced against me, and came together: * scourges were gathered together upon me, and I knew not.
They were separated, and repented not: they tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn: * they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? * rescue thou soul from their malice: my only one from the lions.
