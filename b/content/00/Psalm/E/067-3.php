Psalm 67 iii
They have seen thy goings, O God, * the goings of my God: of my king who is in his sanctuary.
Princes went before joined with singers, * in the midst of young damsels playing on timbrels.
In the churches bless ye God the Lord, * from the fountains of Israel.
There is Benjamin a youth, * in ecstasy of mind.
The princes of Juda are their leaders: * the princes of Zabulon, the princes of Nephthali.
Command thy strength, O God: * confirm, O God, what thou hast wrought in us.
From thy temple in Jerusalem, * kings shall offer presents to thee.
Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds, the congregation of bulls with the kine of the people; * who seek to exclude them who are tried with silver.
Scatter thou the nations that delight in wars: ambassadors shall come out of Egypt: * Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God.
Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth: * sing ye to the Lord:
Sing ye to God, who mounteth above the heaven of heavens, * to the east.
Behold he will give to his voice the voice of power: give ye glory to God for Israel, * his magnificence, and his power is in the clouds.
God is wonderful in his saints: the God of Israel is he who will give power and strength to his people; * blessed be God.
