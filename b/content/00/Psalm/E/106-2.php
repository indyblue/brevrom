Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, * and his wonderful works to the children of men.
Because he hath broken gates of brass, * and burst the iron bars.
He took them out of the way of their iniquity: * for they were brought low for their injustices.
Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: * and they drew nigh even to the gates of death.
And they cried to the Lord in their affliction: * and he delivered them out of their distresses.
He sent his word, and healed them: * and delivered them from their destructions.
Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: * and his wonderful works to the children of men.
And let them sacrifice the sacrifice of praise: * and declare his works with joy.
They that go down to the sea in ships, * doing business in the great waters:
These have seen the works of the Lord, * and his wonders in the deep.
He said the word, and there arose a storm of wind: * and the waves thereof were lifted up.
They mount up to the heavens, and they go down to the depths: * their soul pined away with evils.
They were troubled, and reeled like a drunken man; * and all their wisdom was swallowed up.
And they cried to the Lord in their affliction: * and he brought them out of their distresses.
And he turned the storm into a breeze: * and its waves were still.
And they rejoiced because they were still: * and he brought them to the haven which they wished for.
