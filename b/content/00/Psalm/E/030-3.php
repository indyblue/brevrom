Psalmus 30 iii. Quam magna
O how great is the multitude of thy sweetness, O Lord, * which thou hast hidden for them that fear thee!
Which thou hast wrought for them that hope in thee, * in the sight of the sons of men.
Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face, * from the disturbance of men.
Thou shalt protect them in thy tabernacle * from the contradiction of tongues.
Blessed be the Lord, * for he hath shewn his wonderful mercy to me in a fortified city.
But I said in the excess of my mind: * I am cast away from before thy eyes.
Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer, * when I cried to thee.
O love the Lord, all ye his saints: * for the Lord will require truth, and will repay them abundantly that act proudly.
Do ye manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, * all ye that hope in the Lord.
