Psalm 21 i
O God my God, look upon me: why hast thou forsaken me? * Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.
O my God, I shall cry by day, and thou wilt not hear: * and by night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me.
But thou dwellest in the holy place, * the praise of Israel.
In thee have our fathers hoped: * they have hoped, and thou hast delivered them.
They cried to thee, and they were saved: * they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
But I am a worm, and no man: * the reproach of men, and the outcast of the people.
All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: * they have spoken with the lips, and wagged the head.
He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him: * let him save him, seeing he delighteth in him.
For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb: * my hope from the breasts of my mother. I was cast upon thee from the womb.
From my motherâ€™s womb thou art my God, * depart not from me.
For tribulation is very near: * for there is none to help me.
