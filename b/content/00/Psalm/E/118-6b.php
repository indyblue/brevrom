Lam√©d
For ever, O Lord, * thy word standeth firm in heaven.
Thy truth unto all generations: * thou hast founded the earth, and it continueth.
By thy ordinance the day goeth on: * for all things serve thee.
Unless thy law had been my meditation, * I had then perhaps perished in my abjection.
Thy justifications I will never forget: * for by them thou hast given me life.
I am thine, save thou me: * for I have sought thy justifications.
The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: * but I have understood thy testimonies.
I have seen an end of all perfection: * thy commandment is exceeding broad.
