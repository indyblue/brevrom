My bone is not hidden from thee, which thou hast made in secret: * and my substance in the lower parts of the earth.
Thy eyes did see my imperfect being, and in thy book all shall be written: * days shall be formed, and no one in them.
But to me thy friends, O God, are made exceedingly honourable: * their principality is exceedingly strengthened.
I will number them, and they shall be multiplied above the sand: * I rose up and am still with thee.
If thou wilt kill the wicked, O God: * ye men of blood, depart from me:
Because you say in thought: * They shall receive thy cities in vain.
Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hated thee: * and pined away because of thy enemies?
I have hated them with a perfect hatred: * and they are become enemies to me.
Prove me, O God, and know my heart: * examine me, and know my paths.
And see if there be in me the way of iniquity: * and lead me in the eternal way.
