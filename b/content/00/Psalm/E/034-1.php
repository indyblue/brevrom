Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me: * overthrow them that fight against me.
Take hold of arms and shield: * and rise up to help me.
Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that persecute me: * say to my soul: I am thy salvation.
Let them be confounded and ashamed * that seek after my soul.
Let them be turned back and be confounded * that devise against me.
Let them become as dust before the wind: * and let the Angel of the Lord straiten them.
Let their way become dark and slippery; * and let the Angel of the Lord pursue them.
For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction: * without cause they have upbraided my soul.
Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: * and into that very snare let them fall.
But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; * and shall be delighted in his salvation.
All my bones shall say: * Lord, who is like to thee?
Who deliverest the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he; * the needy and the poor from them that strip him.
