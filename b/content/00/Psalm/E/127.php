Psalm 127
Blessed are all they that fear the Lord: *‡ that walk in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labours of thy hands: * blessed art thou, and it shall be well with thee.
Thy wife as a fruitful vine, * on the sides of thy house.
Thy children as olive plants, * round about thy table.
Behold, thus shall the man be blessed * that feareth the Lord.
May the Lord bless thee out of Sion: * and mayst thou see the good things of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
And mayst thou see thy children’s children, * peace upon Israel.
