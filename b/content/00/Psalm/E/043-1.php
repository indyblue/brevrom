Psalmus 43 i. Deus Ã¡uribus
We have heard, O God, with our ears: * our fathers have declared to us,
The work thou hast wrought in their days, * and in the days of old.
Thy hand destroyed the Gentiles, and thou plantedst them: * thou didst afflict the people and cast them out.
For they got not the possession of the land by their own sword: * neither did their own arm save them.
But thy right hand and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance: * because thou wast pleased with them.
Thou art thyself my king and my God, * who commandest the saving of Jacob.
Through thee we will push down our enemies with the horn: * and through thy name we will despise them that rise up against us.
For I will not trust in my bow: * neither shall my sword save me.
But thou hast saved us from them that afflict us: * and hast put them to shame that hate us.
In God shall we glory all the day long: * and in thy name we will give praise for ever.
