Let them be turned backward and be ashamed * that desire evils to me.
Let them immediately bear their confusion, * that say to me: ‘T is well, ‘t is well.
Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: * and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.
But I am a beggar and poor: * the Lord is careful for me.
Thou art my helper and my protector: * O my God, be not slack.
