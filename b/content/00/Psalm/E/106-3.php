Psalm 106 iii
Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, * and his wonderful works to the children of men.
And let them exalt him in the church of the people: * and praise him in the chair of the ancients.
He hath turned rivers into a wilderness: * and the sources of waters into dry ground:
A fruitful land into barrenness, * for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
He hath turned a wilderness into pools of waters, * and a dry land into water springs.
And hath placed there the hungry; * and they made a city for their habitation.
And they sowed fields, and planted vineyards: * and they yielded fruit of birth.
And he blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly: * and their cattle he suffered not to decrease.
Then they were brought to be few: * and they were afflicted through the trouble of evils and sorrow.
Contempt was poured forth upon their princes: *and he caused them to wander where there was no passing, and out of the way.
And he helped the poor out of poverty: * and made him families like a flock of sheep.
The just shall see, and shall rejoice, * and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
Who is wise, and will keep these things: * and will understand the mercies of the Lord?
