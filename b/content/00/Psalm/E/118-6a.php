Caph
My soul hath fainted after thy salvation: * and in thy word I have very much hoped.
My eyes have failed for thy word, * saying: When wilt thou comfort me?
For I am become like a bottle in the frost: * I have not forgotten thy justifications.
How many are the days of thy servant: * when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
The wicked have told me fables: * but not as thy law.
All thy statutes are truth: * they have persecuted me unjustly, do thou help me.
They had almost made an end of me upon earth: * but I have not forsaken thy commandments.
Quicken thou me according to thy mercy: * and I shall keep the testimonies of thy mouth.
