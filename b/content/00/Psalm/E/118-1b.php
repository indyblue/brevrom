BÃ©th
By what doth a young man correct his way? * By observing thy words.
With my whole heart have I sought after thee: * let me not stray from thy commandments.
Thy words have I hidden in my heart, * that I may not sin against thee.
Blessed art thou, O Lord: * teach me thy justifications.
With my lips * I have pronounced all the judgments of thy mouth.
I have been delighted in the way of thy testimonies, * as in all riches.
I will meditate on thy commandments: * and I will consider thy ways.
I will think of thy justifications: * I will not forget thy words.
