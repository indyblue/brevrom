But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them: * when they were lifted up thou hast cast them down.
How are they brought to desolation? they have suddenly ceased to be: * they have perished by reason of their iniquity.
As the dream of them that awake, O Lord; * so in thy city thou shalt bring their image to nothing.
For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed: * and I am brought to nothing, and I knew not.
I am become as a beast before thee: * and I am always with thee.
Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast conducted me, * and with thy glory thou hast received me.
For what have I in heaven? * and besides thee what do I desire upon earth?
For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away: * thou art the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever.
For behold they that go far from thee shall perish: * thou hast destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee.
But it is good for me to adhere to my God, * to put my hope in the Lord God:
That I may declare all thy praises, * in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
