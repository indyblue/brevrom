Psalm 43 ii
But now thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame: * and thou, O God, wilt not go out with our armies.
Thou hast made us turn our back to our enemies: * and they that hated us plundered for themselves.
Thou hast given us up like sheep to be eaten: * thou hast scattered us among the nations.
Thou hast sold thy people for no price: * and there was no reckoning in the exchange of them.
Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, * a scoff and derision to them that are round about us.
Thou hast made us a byword among the Gentiles: * a shaking of the head among the people.
All the day long my shame is before me: * and the confusion of my face hath covered me.
At the voice of him that reproacheth and detracteth me: * at the face of the enemy and persecutor.
All these things have come upon us, yet we have not forgotten thee: * and we have not done wickedly in thy covenant.
And our heart hath not turned back: * neither hast thou turned aside our steps from thy way.
For thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction: * and the shadow of death hath covered us.
