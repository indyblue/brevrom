Psalmus 65 ii. Intro√≠bo in domum
I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: * I will pay thee my vows, which my lips have uttered,
And my mouth hath spoken, * when I was in trouble.
I will offer up to thee holocausts full of marrow, with burnt offerings of rams: * I will offer to thee bullocks with goats.
Come and hear, all ye that fear God, * and I will tell you what great things he hath done for my soul.
I cried to him with my mouth: * and I extolled him with my tongue.
If I have looked at iniquity in my heart, * the Lord will not hear me.
Therefore hath God heard me, * and hath attended to the voice of my supplication.
Blessed be God, * who hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
