Lord, thou hast proved me, and known me: *‡ thou hast known my sitting down, and my rising up.
Thou hast understood my thoughts afar off: * my path and my line thou hast searched out.
And thou hast foreseen all my ways: * for there is no speech in my tongue.
Behold, O Lord, thou hast known all things, the last and those of old: * thou hast formed me, and hast laid thy hand upon me.
Thy knowledge is become wonderful to me: * it is high, and I cannot reach to it.
Whither shall I go from thy spirit? * or whither shall I flee from thy face?
If I ascend into heaven, thou art there: * if I descend into hell, thou art present.
If I take my wings early in the morning, * and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea:
Even there also shall thy hand lead me: * and thy right hand shall hold me.
And I said: Perhaps darkness shall cover me: * and night shall be my light in my pleasures.
But darkness shall not be dark to thee, and night shall be light as the day: * the darkness thereof, and the light thereof are alike to thee.
For thou hast possessed my reins: * thou hast protected me from my mother’s womb.
