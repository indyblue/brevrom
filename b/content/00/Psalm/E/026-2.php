My heart hath said to thee: My face hath sought thee: * thy face, O Lord, will I still seek.
Turn not away thy face from me; * decline not in thy wrath from thy servant.
Be thou my helper, * forsake me not; do not thou despise me, O God my Saviour.
For my father and my mother have left me: * but the Lord hath taken me up.
Set me, O Lord, a law in thy way, * and guide me in the right path, because of my enemies.
Deliver me not over to the will of them that trouble me; * for unjust witnesses have risen up against me; and iniquity hath lied to itself.
I believe to see the good things of the Lord * in the land of the living.
Expect the Lord, do manfully, * and let thy heart take courage, and wait thou for the Lord.
