O God, why hast thou cast us off unto the end: * why is thy wrath enkindled against the sheep of thy pasture?
Remember thy congregation, * which thou hast possessed from the beginning.
The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed: * mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt.
Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; * see what things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
And they that hate thee have made their boasts, * in the midst of thy solemnity.
They have set up their ensigns for signs, * and they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top.
As with axes in a wood of trees, they have cut down at once the gates thereof, * with axe and hatchet they have brought it down.
They have set fire to thy sanctuary: * they have defiled the dwelling place of thy name on the earth.
They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together: * Let us abolish all the festival days of God from the land.
Our signs we have not seen, there is now no prophet: * and he will know us no more.
