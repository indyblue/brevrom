I cried to the Lord with my voice; * to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.
In the day of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to him in the night, * and I was not deceived.
My soul refused to be comforted: * I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my spirit swooned away.
My eyes prevented the watches: * I was troubled, and I spoke not.
I thought upon the days of old: * and I had in my mind the eternal years.
And I meditated in the night with my own heart: * and I was exercised and I swept my spirit.
Will God then cast off for ever? * or will he never be more favourable again?
Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, * from generation to generation?
Or will God forget to shew mercy? * or will he in his anger shut up his mercies?
And I said, Now have I begun: * this is the change of the right hand of the most High.
I remembered the works of the Lord: * for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the beginning.
And I will meditate on all thy works: * and will be employed in thy inventions.
