Psalmus 9 ii. Psállite Dómino
Sing ye to the Lord, who dwelleth in Sion: * declare his ways among the Gentiles.
For requiring their blood he hath remembered them: * he hath not forgotten the cry of the poor.
Have mercy on me, O Lord: * see my humiliation which I suffer from my enemies.
Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death, * that I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
I will rejoice in thy salvation: * the Gentiles have stuck fast in the destruction which they have prepared.
Their foot hath been taken * in the very snare which they hid.
The Lord shall be known when he executeth judgments: * the sinner hath been caught in the works of his own hands.
The wicked shall be turned into hell, * all the nations that forget God.
