Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; * and defend me from them that rise up against me.
Deliver me from them that work iniquity, * and save me from bloody men.
For behold they have caught my soul: * the mighty have rushed in upon me:
Neither is it my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord: * without iniquity have I run, and directed my steps.
Rise up thou to meet me, and behold: * even thou, O Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel.
Attend to visit all the nations: * have no mercy on all them that work iniquity.
They shall return at evening, and shall suffer hunger like dogs: * and shall go round about the city.
Behold they shall speak with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips: * for who, say they, hath heard us?
But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them: * thou shalt bring all the nations to nothing.
I will keep my strength to thee: for thou art my protector: * my God, his mercy shall prevent me.
