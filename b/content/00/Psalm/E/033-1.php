I will bless the Lord at all times, * his praise shall be always in my mouth.
In the Lord shall my soul be praised: * let the meek hear and rejoice.
O magnify the Lord with me; * and let us extol his name together.
I sought the Lord, and he heard me; * and he delivered me from all my troubles.
Come ye to him and be enlightened: * and your faces shall not be confounded.
This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him: * and saved him out of all his troubles.
The Angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear him: * and shall deliver them.
O taste, and see that the Lord is sweet: * blessed is the man that hopeth in him.
Fear the Lord, all ye his saints: * for there is no want to them that fear him.
The rich have wanted, and have suffered hunger: * but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good.
