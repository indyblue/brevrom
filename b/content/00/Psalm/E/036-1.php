Psalmus 36 i. Noli æmulári
Be not emulous of evildoers; * nor envy them that work iniquity.
For they shall shortly wither away as grass, * and as the green herbs shall quickly fall.
Trust in the Lord, and do good, * and dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed with its riches.
Delight in the Lord, * and he will give thee the requests of thy heart.
Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, * and he will do it.
And he will bring forth thy justice as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday: * be subject to the Lord and pray to him.
Envy not the man who prospereth in his way; * the man who doth unjust things.
Cease from anger, and leave rage; * have no emulation to do evil.
For evildoers shall be cut off: * but they that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the land.
For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: * and thou shalt seek his place, and shalt not find it.
But the meek shall inherit the land, * and shall delight in abundance of peace.
The sinner shall watch the just man: * and shall gnash upon him with his teeth.
But the Lord shall laugh at him: * for he foreseeth that his day shall come.
The wicked have drawn out the sword: * they have bent their bow.
To cast down the poor and needy, * to kill the upright of heart.
Let their sword enter into their own hearts, * and let their bow be broken.
