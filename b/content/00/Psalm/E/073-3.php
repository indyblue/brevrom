Psalmus 73 iii. Memor esto hujus
Remember this, the enemy hath reproached the Lord: * and a foolish people hath provoked thy name.
Deliver not up to beasts the souls that confess to thee: * and forget not to the end the souls of thy poor.
Have regard to thy covenant: * for they that are the obscure of the earth have been filled with dwellings of iniquity.
Let not the humble be turned away with confusion: * the poor and needy shall praise thy name.
Arise, O God, judge thy own cause: * remember thy reproaches with which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day.
Forget not the voices of thy enemies: * the pride of them that hate thee ascendeth continually.
