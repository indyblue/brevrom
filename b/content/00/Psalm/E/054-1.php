Psalm 54 i
Hear, O God, my prayer, and despise not my supplication: * be attentive to me and hear me.
I am grieved in my exercise; * and am troubled, at the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner.
For they have cast iniquities upon me; * and in wrath they were troublesome to me.
My heart is troubled within me: * and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
Fear and trembling are come upon me: * and darkness hath covered me.
And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, * and I will fly and be at rest?
Lo, I have gone far off flying away; * and I abode in the wilderness.
I waited for him that hath saved me * from pusillanimity of spirit, and a storm.
Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; * for I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.
Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: * and in the midst thereof are labour, and injustice.
And usury and deceit * have not departed from its streets.
For if my enemy had reviled me, * I would verily have borne with it.
And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, * I would perhaps have hidden myself from him.
But thou a man of one mind, * my guide, and my familiar.
Who didst take sweetmeats together with me: * in the house of God we walked with consent.
Let death come upon them, * and let them go down alive into hell.
For there is wickedness in their dwellings: * in the midst of them.
