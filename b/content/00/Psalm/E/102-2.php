As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that fear him: * for he knoweth our frame.
He remembereth that we are dust: * man’s days are as grass, as the flower of the field so shall he flourish.
For the spirit shall pass in him, and he shall not be: * and he shall know his place no more.
But the mercy of the Lord is from eternity * and unto eternity upon them that fear him:
And his justice unto children’s children, * to such as keep his covenant,
And are mindful of his commandments * to do them.
The Lord hath prepared his throne in heaven: * and his kingdom shall rule over all.
Bless the Lord, all ye his angels: * you that are mighty in strength, and execute his word, hearkening to the voice of his orders.
Bless the Lord, all ye his hosts: * you ministers of his that do his will.
Bless the Lord, all his works: * in every place of his dominion, O my soul, bless thou the Lord.
