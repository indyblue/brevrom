Psalm 68 iii
But I am poor and sorrowful: * thy salvation, O God, hath set me up.
I will praise the name of God with a canticle: * and I will magnify him with praise.
And it shall please God better than a young calf, * that bringeth forth horns and hoofs.
Let the poor see and rejoice: * seek ye God, and your soul shall live.
For the Lord hath heard the poor: * and hath not despised his prisoners.
Let the heavens and the earth praise him; * the sea, and every thing that creepeth therein.
For God will save Sion, * and the cities of Juda shall be built up.
And they shall dwell there, * and acquire it by inheritance.
And the seed of his servants shall possess it; * and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
