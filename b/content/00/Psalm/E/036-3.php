Psalmus 36 iii. Os justi medit√°bitur
The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom: * and his tongue shall speak judgment.
The law of his God is in his heart, * and his steps shall not be supplanted.
The wicked watcheth the just man, * and seeketh to put him to death.
But the Lord will not leave him in his hands; * nor condemn him when he shall be judged.
Expect the Lord and keep his way: and he will exalt thee to inherit the land: * when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see.
I have seen the wicked highly exalted, * and lifted up like the cedars of Libanus.
And I passed by, and lo, he was not: * and I sought him and his place was not found.
Keep innocence, and behold justice: * for there are remnants for the peaceable man.
But the unjust shall be destroyed together: * the remnants of the wicked shall perish.
But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, * and he is their protector in the time of trouble.
And the Lord will help them and deliver them: * and he will rescue them from the wicked, and save them, because they have hoped in him.
