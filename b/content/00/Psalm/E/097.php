Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle: * because he hath done wonderful things.
His right hand hath wrought for him salvation, * and his arm is holy.
The Lord hath made known his salvation: * he hath revealed his justice in the sight of the Gentiles.
He hath remembered his mercy * and his truth toward the house of Israel.
All the ends of the earth have seen * the salvation of our God.
Sing joyfully to God, all the earth; * make melody, rejoice and sing.
Sing praise to the Lord on the harp, on the harp, and with the voice of a psalm: * with long trumpets, and sound of cornet.
Make a joyful noise before the Lord our king: * let the sea be moved and the fulness thereof: the world and they that dwell therein.
The rivers shall clap their hands, the mountains shall rejoice together at the presence of the Lord: * because he cometh to judge the earth.
He shall judge the world with justice, * and the people with equity.
