Psalm 118 x (Coph, Res)
I cried with my whole heart, hear me, O Lord: * I will seek thy justifications.
I cried unto thee, save me: * that I may keep thy commandments.
I prevented the dawning of the day, and cried: * because in thy words I very much hoped.
My eyes to thee have prevented the morning: * that I might meditate on thy words.
Hear thou my voice, O Lord, according to thy mercy: * and quicken me according to thy judgment.
They that persecute me have drawn nigh to iniquity; * but they are gone far off from thy law.
Thou art near, O Lord: * and all thy ways are truth.
I have known from the beginning concerning thy testimonies: * that thou hast founded them for ever.
See my humiliation and deliver me: * for I have not forgotten thy law.
Judge my judgment and redeem me: * quicken thou me for thy wordâ€™s sake.
Salvation is far from sinners; * because they have not sought thy justifications.
Many, O Lord, are thy mercies: * quicken me according to thy judgment.
Many are they that persecute me, and afflict me; * but I have not declined from thy testimonies.
I beheld the transgressors, and I pined away; * because they kept not thy word.
Behold I have loved thy commandments, O Lord; * quicken me thou in thy mercy.
The beginning of thy words is truth: * all the judgments of thy justice are for ever.
