Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: * my eye is troubled with wrath, my soul, and my belly:
For my life is wasted with grief: * and my years in sighs.
My strength is weakened through poverty * and my bones are disturbed.
I am become a reproach among all my enemies, and very much to my neighbours; * and a fear to my acquaintance.
They that saw me without fled from me. * I am forgotten as one dead from the heart.
I am become as a vessel that is destroyed. * For I have heard the blame of many that dwell round about.
While they assembled together against me, * they consulted to take away my life.
But I have put my trust in thee, O Lord: * I said: Thou art my God. My lots are in thy hands.
Deliver me out of the hands of my enemies; * and from them that persecute me.
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save me in thy mercy. * Let me not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon thee.
Let the wicked be ashamed, and be brought down to hell. * Let deceitful lips be made dumb.
Which speak iniquity against the just, * with pride and abuse.
