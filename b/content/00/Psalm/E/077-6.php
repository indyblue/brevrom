Psalm 77 vi
God heard, and despised them, * and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing.
And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, * his tabernacle where he dwelt among men.
And he delivered their strength into captivity: * and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.
And he shut up his people under the sword: * and he despised his inheritance.
Fire consumed their young men: * and their maidens were not lamented.
Their priests fell by the sword: * and their widows did not mourn.
And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, * and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine.
And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: * he put them to an everlasting reproach.
And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: * and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
But he chose the tribe of Juda, * mount Sion which he loved.
And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land * which he founded for ever.
And he chose his servant David, and took him from the flocks of sheep: * he brought him from following the ewes great with young,
To feed Jacob his servant, * and Israel his inheritance.
And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: * and conducted them by the skilfulness of his hands.
