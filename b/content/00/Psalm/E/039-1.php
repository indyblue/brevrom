With expectation I have waited for the Lord, * and he was attentive to me.
And he heard my prayers, * and brought me out of the pit of misery and the mire of dregs.
And he set my feet upon a rock, * and directed my steps.
And he put a new canticle into my mouth, * a song to our God.
Many shall see, and shall fear: * and they shall hope in the Lord.
Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord; * and who hath not had regard to vanities, and lying follies.
Thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, O Lord my God: * and in thy thoughts there is no one like to thee.
I have declared and I have spoken * they are multiplied above number.
Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire; * but thou hast pierced ears for me.
Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not require: * then said I, Behold I come.
In the head of the book it is written of me that I should do thy will: * O my God, I have desired it, and thy law in the midst of my heart.
