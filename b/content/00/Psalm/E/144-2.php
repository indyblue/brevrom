Psalm 144 ii
The Lord is gracious and merciful: * patient and plenteous in mercy.
The Lord is sweet to all: * and his tender mercies are over all his works.
Let all thy works, O Lord, praise thee: * and let thy saints bless thee.
They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom: * and shall tell of thy power:
To make thy might known to the sons of men: * and the glory of the magnificence of thy kingdom.
Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages: * and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
