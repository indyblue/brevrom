Psalmus 9 iv. Exsúrge, Dómine Deus
Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: *‡ forget not the poor.
Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? * for he hath said in his heart: He will not require it.
Thou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: * that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands.
To thee is the poor man left: * thou wilt be a helper to the orphan.
Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant: * his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found.
The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever: * ye Gentiles shall perish from his land.
The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor: * thy ear hath heard the preparation of their heart.
To judge for the fatherless and for the humble, * that man may no more presume to magnify himself upon earth.
