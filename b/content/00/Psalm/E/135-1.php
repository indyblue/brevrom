Psalm 135 i
Praise the Lord, for he is good: * for his mercy endureth for ever.
Praise ye the God of gods: * for his mercy endureth for ever.
Praise ye the Lord of lords: * for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who alone doth great wonders: * for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who made the heavens in understanding: * for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who established the earth above the waters: * for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who made the great lights: * for his mercy endureth for ever.
The sun to rule the day: * for his mercy endureth for ever.
The moon and the stars to rule the night: * for his mercy endureth for ever.
