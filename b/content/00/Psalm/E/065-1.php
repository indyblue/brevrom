Psalm 65 i
Shout with joy to God, all the earth, sing ye a psalm to his name; * give glory to his praise.
Say unto God, How terrible are thy works, O Lord! * in the multitude of thy strength thy enemies shall lie to thee.
Let all the earth adore thee, * and sing to thee: let it sing a psalm to thy name.
Come and see the works of God; * who is terrible in his counsels over the sons of men.
Who turneth the sea into dry land, in the river they shall pass on foot: * there shall we rejoice in him.
Who by his power ruleth for ever: his eyes behold the nations; * let not them that provoke him he exalted in themselves.
O bless our God, ye Gentiles: * and make the voice of his praise to be heard.
Who hath set my soul to live: * and hath not suffered my feet to be moved:
For thou, O God, hast proved us: * thou hast tried us by fire, as silver is tried.
Thou hast brought us into a net, thou hast laid afflictions on our back: * thou hast set men over our heads.
We have passed through fire and water, * and thou hast brought us out into a refreshment.
