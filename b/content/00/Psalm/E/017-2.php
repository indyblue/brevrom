Psalmus 17 ii. Misit de summo
He sent from on high, and took me: * and received me out of many waters.
He delivered me from my strongest enemies, and from them that hated me: * for they were too strong for me.
They prevented me in the day of my affliction: * and the Lord became my protector.
And he brought me forth into a large place: * he saved me, because he was well pleased with me.
And the Lord will reward me according to my justice; * and will repay me according to the cleanness of my hands:
Because I have kept the ways of the Lord; * and have not done wickedly against my God.
For all his judgments are in my sight: * and his justices I have not put away from me.
And I shall be spotless with him: * and shall keep myself from my iniquity.
And the Lord will reward me according to my justice: * and according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.
With the holy thou wilt be holy; * and with the innocent man thou wilt be innocent:
And with the elect thou wilt be elect: * and with the perverse thou wilt be perverted.
For thou wilt save the humble people; * but wilt bring down the eyes of the proud.
For thou lightest my lamp, O Lord: * O my God, enlighten my darkness.
For by thee I shall be delivered from temptation; * and through my God I shall go over a wall.
As for my God, his way is undefiled: the words of the Lord are fire-tried: * he is the protector of all that trust in him.
For who is God but the Lord? * or who is God but our God?
God, who hath girt me with strength; * and made my way blameless.
Who hath made my feet like the feet of harts: * and who setteth me upon high places.
Who teacheth my hands to war: * and thou hast made my arms like a brazen bow.
