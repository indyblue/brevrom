Psalm 118 viii (Samech, Ain)
I have hated the unjust: * and have loved thy law.
Thou art my helper and my protector: * and in thy word I have greatly hoped.
Depart from me, ye malignant: * and I will search the commandments of my God.
Uphold me according to thy word, and I shall live: * and let me not be confounded in my expectation.
Help me, and I shall be saved: * and I will meditate always on thy justifications.
Thou hast despised all them that fall off from thy judgments; * for their thought is unjust.
I have accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators: * therefore have I loved thy testimonies.
Pierce thou my flesh with thy fear: * for I am afraid of thy judgments.
I have done judgment and justice: * give me not up to them that slander me.
Uphold thy servant unto good: * let not the proud calumniate me.
My eyes have fainted after thy salvation: * and for the word of thy justice.
Deal with thy servant according to thy mercy: * and teach me thy justifications.
I am thy servant: * give me understanding that I may know thy testimonies.
It is time, O Lord, to do: * they have dissipated thy law.
Therefore have I loved thy commandments * above gold and the topaz.
Therefore was I directed to all thy commandments: * I have hated all wicked ways.
