Psalm 41 i
As the hart panteth after the fountains of water; * so my soul panteth after thee, O God.
My soul hath thirsted after the strong living God; * when shall I come and appear before the face of God?
My tears have been my bread day and night, * whilst it is said to me daily: Where is thy God?
These things I remembered, and poured out my soul in me: * for I shall go over into the place of the wonderful tabernacle, even to the house of God:
With the voice of joy and praise; * the noise of one feasting.
Why art thou sad, O my soul? * and why dost thou trouble me?
Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him: * the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
