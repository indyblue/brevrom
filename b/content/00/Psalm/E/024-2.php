He will guide the mild in judgment: * he will teach the meek his ways.
All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, * to them that seek after his covenant and his testimonies.
For thy nameâ€™s sake, O Lord, thou wilt pardon my sin: * for it is great.
Who is the man that feareth the Lord? * He hath appointed him a law in the way he hath chosen.
His soul shall dwell in good things: * and his seed shall inherit the land.
The Lord is a firmament to them that fear him: * and his covenant shall be made manifest to them.
