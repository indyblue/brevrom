Psalm 103 iii
How great are thy works, O Lord? * thou hast made all things in wisdom: the earth is filled with thy riches.
So is this great sea, which stretcheth wide its arms: * there are creeping things without number:
Creatures little and great. * There the ships shall go.
This sea dragon which thou hast formed to play therein. * All expect of thee that thou give them food in season.
What thou givest to them they shall gather up: * when thou openest thy hand, they shall all be filled with good.
But if thou turnest away thy face, they shall be troubled: * thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall return to their dust.
Thou shalt send forth thy spirit, and they shall be created: * and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.
May the glory of the Lord endure for ever: * the Lord shall rejoice in his works.
He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble: * he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
I will sing to the Lord as long as I live: * I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
Let my speech be acceptable to him: * but I will take delight in the Lord.
Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the unjust, so that they be no more: * O my soul, bless thou the Lord.
