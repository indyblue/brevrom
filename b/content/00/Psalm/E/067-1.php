Psalmus 67 i. Exsúrgat Deus
Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: *‡ and let them that hate him flee from before his face.
As smoke vanisheth, so let them vanish away: * as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
And let the just feast, and rejoice before God: * and be delighted with gladness.
Sing ye to God, sing a psalm to his name, * make a way for him who ascendeth upon the west: the Lord is his name.
Rejoice ye before him: * but the wicked shall be troubled at his presence, who is the father of orphans, and the judge of widows.
God in his holy place: * God who maketh men of one manner to dwell in a house:
Who bringeth out them that were bound in strength; * in like manner them that provoke, that dwell in sepulchres.
O God, when thou didst go forth in the sight of thy people, * when thou didst pass through the desert:
The earth was moved, and the heavens dropped at the presence of the God of Sinai, * at the presence of the God of Israel.
Thou shalt set aside for thy inheritance a free rain, * O God: and it was weakened, but thou hast made it perfect.
In it shall thy animals dwell; * in thy sweetness, O God, thou hast provided for the poor.
