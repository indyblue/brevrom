Hear, O Lord, my prayer: * and let my cry come to thee.
Turn not away thy face from me: * in the day when I am in trouble, incline thy ear to me.
In what day soever I shall call upon thee, * hear me speedily.
For my days are vanished like smoke: * and my bones are grown dry like fuel for the fire.
I am smitten as grass, and my heart is withered: * because I forgot to eat my bread.
Through the voice of my groaning, * my bone hath cleaved to my flesh.
I am become like to a pelican of the wilderness: * I am like a night raven in the house.
I have watched, * and am become as a sparrow all alone on the housetop.
All the day long my enemies reproached me: * and they that praised me did swear against me.
For I did eat ashes like bread, * and mingled my drink with weeping.
Because of thy anger and indignation: * for having lifted me up thou hast thrown me down.
My days have declined like a shadow, * and I am withered like grass.
But thou, O Lord, endurest for ever: * and thy memorial to all generations.
