Why, O Lord, hast thou retired afar off? *â€¡ why dost thou slight us in our wants, in the time of trouble?
Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: * they are caught in the counsels which they devise.
For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: * and the unjust man is blessed.
The sinner hath provoked the Lord, * according to the multitude of his wrath he will not seek him.
God is not before his eyes: * his ways are filthy at all times.
Thy judgments are removed from his sight: * he shall rule over all his enemies.
For he hath said in his heart: * I shall not be moved from generation to generation, and shall be without evil.
His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of deceit: * under his tongue are labour and sorrow.
He sitteth in ambush with the rich, in private places, * that he may kill the innocent.
His eyes are upon the poor man: * he lieth in wait, in secret, like a lion in his den.
He lieth in ambush, that he may catch the poor man: * so catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him.
In his net he will bring him down, * he will crouch and fall, when he shall have power over the poor.
For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, * he hath turned away his face, not to see to the end.
