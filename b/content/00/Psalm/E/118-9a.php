Phe
Thy testimonies are wonderful: * therefore my soul hath sought them.
The declaration of thy words giveth light: * and giveth understanding to little ones.
I opened my mouth, and panted: * because I longed for thy commandments.
Look thou upon me, and have mercy on me, * according to the judgment of them that love thy name.
Direct my steps according to thy word: * and let no iniquity have dominion over me.
Redeem me from the calumnies of men: * that I may keep thy commandments.
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: * and teach me thy justifications.
My eyes have sent forth springs of water: * because they have not kept thy law.
