Blessed be the Lord my God, who teacheth my hands to fight, * and my fingers to war.
My mercy, and my refuge: * my support, and my deliverer:
My protector, and I have hoped in him: * who subdueth my people under me.
Lord, what is man, that thou art made known to him? * or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?
Man is like to vanity: * his days pass away like a shadow.
Lord, bow down thy heavens and descend: * touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
Send forth lightning, and thou shalt scatter them: * shoot out thy arrows, and thou shalt trouble them.
Put forth thy hand from on high, take me out, and deliver me from many waters: * from the hand of strange children:
Whose mouth hath spoken vanity: * and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity.
