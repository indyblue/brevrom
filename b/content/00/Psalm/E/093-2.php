Blessed is the man whom thou shalt instruct, O Lord: * and shalt teach him out of thy law.
That thou mayst give him rest from the evil days: * till a pit be dug for the wicked.
For the Lord will not cast off his people: * neither will he forsake his own inheritance.
Until justice be turned into judgment: * and they that are near it are all the upright in heart.
Who shall rise up for me against the evildoers? * or who shall stand with me against the workers of iniquity?
Unless the Lord had been my helper, * my soul had almost dwelt in hell.
If I said: My foot is moved: * thy mercy, O Lord, assisted me.
According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, * thy comforts have given joy to my soul.
Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee, * who framest labour in commandment?
They will hunt after the soul of the just, * and will condemn innocent blood.
But the Lord is my refuge: * and my God the help of my hope.
And he will render them their iniquity: and in their malice he will destroy them: * the Lord our God will destroy them.
