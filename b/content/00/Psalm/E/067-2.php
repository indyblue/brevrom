Psalmus 67 ii. DÃ³minus dabit
The Lord shall give the word to them that preach good tidings, * with great power.
The king of powers is of the beloved, * of the beloved; and the beauty of the house shall divide spoils.
If you sleep among the midst of lots, you shall be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, * and the hinder parts of her back with the paleness of gold.
When he that is in heaven appointeth kings over her, * they shall be whited with snow in Selmon.
The mountain of God is a fat mountain, a curdled mountain, a fat mountain; * Why suspect, ye curdled mountains?
A mountain in which God is well pleased to dwell: * for there the Lord shall dwell unto the end.
The chariot of God is attended by ten thousands; thousands of them that rejoice: * the Lord is among them in Sinai, in the holy place.
Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive; * thou hast received gifts in men.
Yea for those also that do not believe, * the dwelling of the Lord God.
Blessed be the Lord day by day: * the God of our salvation will make our journey prosperous to us.
Our God is the God of salvation: * and of the Lord, of the Lord are the issues from death.
But God shall break the heads of his enemies: the hairy crown of them that walk on in their sins.
The Lord said: I will turn them from Basan, * I will turn them into the depth of the sea:
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thy enemies; * the tongue of thy dogs be red with the same.
