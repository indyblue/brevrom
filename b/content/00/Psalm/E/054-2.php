Psalmus 54 ii. Ego autem ad Deum
But I have cried to God: * and the Lord will save me.
Evening and morning, and at noon I will speak and declare: * and he shall hear my voice.
He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me: * for among many they were with me.
God shall hear, * and the Eternal shall humble them.
For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God: * he hath stretched forth his hand to repay.
They have defiled his covenant, they are divided by the wrath of his countenance, * and his heart hath drawn near.
His words are smoother than oil, * and the same are darts.
Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: * he shall not suffer the just to waver for ever.
But thou, O God, shalt bring them down * into the pit of destruction.
Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; * but I will trust in thee, O Lord.
