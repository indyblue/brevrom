Mem
O how have I loved thy law, O Lord! * it is my meditation all the day.
Through thy commandment, thou hast made me wiser than my enemies: * for it is ever with me.
I have understood more than all my teachers: * because thy testimonies are my meditation.
I have had understanding above ancients: * because I have sought thy commandments.
I have restrained my feet from every evil way: * that I may keep thy words.
I have not declined from thy judgments, * because thou hast set me a law.
How sweet are thy words to my palate! * more than honey to my mouth.
By thy commandments I have had understanding: * therefore have I hated every way of iniquity.
