Psalm 83 i
How lovely are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! * my soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord.
My heart and my flesh * have rejoiced in the living God.
For the sparrow hath found herself a house, * and the turtle a nest for herself where she may lay her young ones:
Thy altars, O Lord of hosts, * my king and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, O Lord: * they shall praise thee for ever and ever.
Blessed is the man whose help is from thee: * in his heart he hath disposed to ascend by steps, in the vale of tears, in the place which he hath set.
For the lawgiver shall give a blessing, they shall go from virtue to virtue: * the God of gods shall be seen in Sion.
