Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; * nor chastise me in thy wrath.
For thy arrows are fastened in me: * and thy hand hath been strong upon me.
There is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath: * there is no peace for my bones, because of my sins.
For my iniquities are gone over my head: * and as a heavy burden are become heavy upon me.
My sores are putrified and corrupted, * because of my foolishness.
I am become miserable, and am bowed down even to the end: * I walked sorrowful all the day long.
For my loins are filled with illusions; * and there is no health in my flesh.
I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly: * I roared with the groaning of my heart.
Lord, all my desire is before thee, * and my groaning is not hidden from thee.
My heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, * and the light of my eyes itself is not with me.
