Jod
Thy hands have made me and formed me: * give me understanding, and I will learn thy commandments.
They that fear thee shall see me, and shall be glad: * because I have greatly hoped in thy words.
I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are equity: * and in thy truth thou hast humbled me.
O! let thy mercy be for my comfort, * according to thy word unto thy servant.
Let thy tender mercies come unto me, and I shall live: * for thy law is my meditation.
Let the proud be ashamed, because they have done unjustly towards me: * but I will be employed in thy commandments.
Let them that fear thee turn to me: * and they that know thy testimonies.
Let my heart be undefiled in thy justifications, * that I may not be confounded.
