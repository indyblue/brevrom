The Lord is my light and my salvation, * whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the protector of my life: * of whom shall I be afraid?
Whilst the wicked draw near against me, * to eat my flesh.
My enemies that trouble me, * have themselves been weakened, and have fallen.
If armies in camp should stand together against me, * my heart shall not fear.
If a battle should rise up against me, * in this will I be confident.
One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after; * that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.
That I may see the delight of the Lord, * and may visit his temple.
For he hath hidden me in his tabernacle; * in the day of evils, he hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle.
He hath exalted me upon a rock: * and now he hath lifted up my head above my enemies.
I have gone round, and have offered up in his tabernacle a sacrifice of jubilation: * I will sing, and recite a psalm to the Lord.
