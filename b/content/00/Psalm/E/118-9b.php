Sade
Thou art just, O Lord: * and thy judgment is right.
Thou hast commanded justice thy testimonies: * and thy truth exceedingly.
My zeal hath made me pine away: * because my enemies forgot thy words.
Thy word is exceedingly refined: * and thy servant hath loved it.
I am very young and despised; but * I forget not thy justifications.
Thy justice is justice for ever: * and thy law is the truth.
Trouble and anguish have found me: * thy commandments are my meditation.
Thy testimonies are justice for ever: * give me understanding, and I shall live.
