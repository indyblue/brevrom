The Lord is faithful in all his words: * and holy in all his works.â€¡
The Lord lifteth up all that fall: * and setteth up all that are cast down.
The eyes of all hope in thee, O Lord: * and thou givest them meat in due season.
Thou openest thy hand, * and fillest with blessing every living creature.
The Lord is just in all his ways: * and holy in all his works.
The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: * to all that call upon him in truth.
He will do the will of them that fear him: * and he will hear their prayer, and save them.
The Lord keepeth all them that love him; * but all the wicked he will destroy.
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: * and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever; yea, for ever and ever.
