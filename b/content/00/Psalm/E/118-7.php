Psalm 118 vii (Mem, Nun)
O how have I loved thy law, O Lord! * it is my meditation all the day.
Through thy commandment, thou hast made me wiser than my enemies: * for it is ever with me.
I have understood more than all my teachers: * because thy testimonies are my meditation.
I have had understanding above ancients: * because I have sought thy commandments.
I have restrained my feet from every evil way: * that I may keep thy words.
I have not declined from thy judgments, * because thou hast set me a law.
How sweet are thy words to my palate! * more than honey to my mouth.
By thy commandments I have had understanding: * therefore have I hated every way of iniquity.
Thy word is a lamp to my feet, * and a light to my paths.
I have sworn and am determined * to keep the judgments of thy justice.
I have been humbled, O Lord, exceedingly: * quicken thou me according to thy word.
The free offerings of my mouth make acceptable, O Lord: * and teach me thy judgments.
My soul is continually in my hands: * and I have not forgotten thy law.
Sinners have laid a snare for me: * but I have not erred from thy precepts.
I have purchased thy testimonies for an inheritance for ever: * because they are the joy of my heart.
I have inclined my heart to do thy justifications for ever, * for the reward.
