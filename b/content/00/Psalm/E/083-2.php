O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: * give ear, O God of Jacob.
Behold, O God our protector: * and look on the face of thy Christ.
For better is one day in thy courts * above thousands.
I have chosen to be an abject in the house of my God, * rather than to dwell in the tabernacles of sinners.
For God loveth mercy and truth: * the Lord will give grace and glory.
He will not deprive of good things them that walk in innocence: * O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
