My heart hath uttered a good word; * I speak my works to the king;
My tongue is the pen of a scrivener * that writeth swiftly.
Thou art beautiful above the sons of men: grace is poured abroad in thy lips; * therefore hath God blessed thee for ever.
Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, * O thou most mighty.
With thy comeliness and thy beauty * set out, proceed prosperously, and reign.
Because of truth and meekness and justice: * and thy right hand shall conduct thee wonderfully.
Thy arrows are sharp: under thee shall people fall, * into the hearts of the king&apos;s enemies.
Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: * the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of uprightness.
Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: * therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
Myrrh and stacte and cassia perfume thy garments, from the ivory houses: * out of which the daughters of kings have delighted thee in thy glory.
The queen stood on thy right hand, in gilded clothing; * surrounded with variety.
