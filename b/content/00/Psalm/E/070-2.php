Let them be confounded and come to nothing that detract my soul; * let them be covered with confusion and shame that seek my hurt.
But I will always hope; * and will add to all thy praise.
My mouth shall shew forth thy justice; * thy salvation all the day long.
Because I have not known learning, I will enter into the powers of the Lord: * O Lord, I will be mindful of thy justice alone.
Thou hast taught me, O God, from my youth: * and till now I will declare thy wonderful works.
And unto old age and grey hairs: * O God, forsake me not,
Until I shew forth thy arm * to all the generation that is to come:
Thy power, and thy justice, O God, even to the highest great things thou hast done: * O God, who is like to thee?
How great troubles hast thou shewn me, many and grievous: and turning thou hast brought me to life, * and hast brought me back again from the depths of the earth:
Thou hast multiplied thy magnificence; * and turning to me thou hast comforted me.
For I will also confess to thee thy truth with the instruments of psaltery: * O God, I will sing to thee with the harp, thou holy one of Israel.
My lips shall greatly rejoice, when I shall sing to thee; * and my soul which thou hast redeemed.
Yea and my tongue shall meditate on thy justice all the day; * when they shall be confounded and put to shame that seek evils to me.
