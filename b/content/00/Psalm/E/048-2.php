Psalmus 48 ii. Hæc via illórum
This way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them: * and afterwards they shall delight in their mouth.
They are laid in hell like sheep: * death shall feed upon them.
And the just shall have dominion over them in the morning; * and their help shall decay in hell from their glory.
But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell, * when he shall receive me.
Be not thou afraid, when a man shall be made rich, * and when the glory of his house shall be increased.
For when he shall die he shall take nothing away; * nor shall his glory descend with him.
For in his lifetime his soul will be blessed: * and he will praise thee when thou shalt do well to him.
He shall go in to the generations of his fathers: * and he shall never see light.
Man when he was in honour did not understand: * he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them.
