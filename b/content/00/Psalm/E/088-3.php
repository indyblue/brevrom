Psalm 88 iii
But thou hast rejected and despised: * thou hast been angry with thy anointed.
Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant: * thou hast profaned his sanctuary on the earth.
Thou hast broken down all his hedges: * thou hast made his strength fear.
All that pass by the way have robbed him: * he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of them that oppress him: * thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
Thou hast turned away the help of his sword; * and hast not assisted him in battle.
Thou hast made his purification to cease: * and thou hast cast his throne down to the ground.
Thou hast shortened the days of his time: * thou hast covered him with confusion.
How long, O Lord, turnest thou away unto the end? * shall thy anger burn like fire?
Remember what my substance is: * for hast thou made all the children of men in vain?
Who is the man that shall live, and not see death: * that shall deliver his soul from the hand of hell?
Lord, where are thy ancient mercies, * according to what thou didst swear to David in thy truth?
Be mindful, O Lord, of the reproach of thy servants * (which I have held in my bosom) of many nations:
Wherewith thy enemies have reproached, O Lord; * wherewith they have reproached the change of thy anointed.
Blessed be the Lord for evermore. * So be it. So be it.
