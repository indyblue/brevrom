May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered in the sight of the Lord: * and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
May they be before the Lord continually, and let the memory of them perish from the earth: * because he remembered not to shew mercy,
But persecuted the poor man and the beggar; * and the broken in heart, to put him to death.
And he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him: * and he would not have blessing, and it shall be far from him.
And he put on cursing, like a garment: * and it went in like water into his entrails, and like oil in his bones.
May it be unto him like a garment which covereth him; * and like a girdle with which he is girded continually.
This is the work of them who detract me before the Lord; * and who speak evils against my soul.
But thou, O Lord, do with me for thy nameâ€™s sake: * because thy mercy is sweet.
