Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord: * the people whom he hath chosen for his inheritance.
The Lord hath looked from heaven: * he hath beheld all the sons of men.
From his habitation which he hath prepared, * he hath looked upon all that dwell on the earth.
He who hath made the hearts of every one of them: * who understandeth all their works.
The king is not saved by a great army: * nor shall the giant be saved by his own great strength.
Vain is the horse for safety: * neither shall he be saved by the abundance of his strength.
Behold the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him: * and on them that hope in his mercy.
To deliver their souls from death; * and feed them in famine.
Our soul waiteth for the Lord: * for he is our helper and protector.
For in him our heart shall rejoice: * and in his holy name we have trusted.
Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, * as we have hoped in thee.
