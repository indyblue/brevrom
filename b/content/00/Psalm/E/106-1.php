Psalmus 106 i. Confitémini Dómino
Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: * for his mercy endureth for ever.
Let them say so that have been redeemed by the Lord, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy: * and gathered out of the countries.
From the rising and the setting of the sun, * from the north and from the sea.
They wandered in a wilderness, in a place without water: * they found not the way of a city for their habitation.
They were hungry and thirsty: * their soul fainted in them.
And they cried to the Lord in their tribulation: * and he delivered them out of their distresses.
And he led them into the right way: * that they might go to a city of habitation.
Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: * and his wonderful works to the children of men.
For he hath satisfied the empty soul, * and hath filled the hungry soul with good things.
Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death: * bound in want and in iron.
Because they had exasperated the words of God: * and provoked the counsel of the most High:
And their heart was humbled with labours: * they were weakened, and their was none to help them.
Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction: * and he delivered them out of their distresses.
And he brought them out of darkness, * and the shadow of death; and broke their bonds in sunder.
