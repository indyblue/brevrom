Psalm 18 ii
The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: * the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.
The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: * the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: * the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.
More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: * and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.
For thy servant keepeth them, * and in keeping them there is a great reward.
Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord: * and from those of others spare thy servant.
If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: * and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin.
And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: * and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight.
O Lord, my helper, * and my redeemer.
