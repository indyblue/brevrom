>The proper Invitatory is said, which is recited twice in its entirety before the Psalm.
Come let us praise the Lord with joy, let us joyfully sing to God, our saviour: let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise to him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods: for the Lord will not cast off his people: for in his hand are all the ends of the earth, and he beholds the heights of the mountains.
>At the words Come let us adore and fall down before God, all genuflect.
For the sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land. COME, LET US ADORE, AND FALL DOWN BEFORE GOD: let us weep before the Lord that made us. For he is the Lord our God: and we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, according to the day of temptation in the desert: where your fathers tempted me, they proved and saw my works.
Forty years long was I nigh to that generation, and I said: These always err in heart; and truly have not known my ways: so I swore in my wrath that they shall not enter into my rest.
Glory be. As it was.
