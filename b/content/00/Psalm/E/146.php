Psalm 146
Praise ye the Lord, because psalm is good: * to our God be joyful and comely praise.
The Lord buildeth up Jerusalem: * he will gather together the dispersed of Israel.
Who healeth the broken of heart, * and bindeth up their bruises.
Who telleth the number of the stars: * and calleth them all by their names.
Great is our Lord, and great is his power: * and of his wisdom there is no number.
The Lord lifteth up the meek, * and bringeth the wicked down even to the ground.
Sing ye to the Lord with praise: * sing to our God upon the harp.
Who covereth the heaven with clouds, * and prepareth rain for the earth.
Who maketh grass to grow on the mountains, * and herbs for the service of men.
Who giveth to beasts their food: * and to the young ravens that call upon him.
He shall not delight in the strength of the horse: * nor take pleasure in the legs of a man.
The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him: * and in them that hope in his mercy.
