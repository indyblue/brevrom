Look thou upon me, and have mercy on me; * for I am alone and poor.
The troubles of my heart are multiplied: * deliver me from my necessities.
See my abjection and my labour; * and forgive me all my sins.
Consider my enemies for they are multiplied, * and have hated me with an unjust hatred.
Keep thou my soul, and deliver me: * I shall not be ashamed, for I have hoped in thee.
The innocent and the upright have adhered to me: * because I have waited on thee.
Deliver Israel, O God, * from all his tribulations.
