Psalmus 118 ix. Mirab√≠lia
~Phe
Thy testimonies are wonderful: * therefore my soul hath sought them.
The declaration of thy words giveth light: * and giveth understanding to little ones.
I opened my mouth, and panted: * because I longed for thy commandments.
Look thou upon me, and have mercy on me, * according to the judgment of them that love thy name.
Direct my steps according to thy word: * and let no iniquity have dominion over me.
Redeem me from the calumnies of men: * that I may keep thy commandments.
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: * and teach me thy justifications.
My eyes have sent forth springs of water: * because they have not kept thy law.
~Sade
Thou art just, O Lord: * and thy judgment is right.
Thou hast commanded justice thy testimonies: * and thy truth exceedingly.
My zeal hath made me pine away: * because my enemies forgot thy words.
Thy word is exceedingly refined: * and thy servant hath loved it.
I am very young and despised; but * I forget not thy justifications.
Thy justice is justice for ever: * and thy law is the truth.
Trouble and anguish have found me: * thy commandments are my meditation.
Thy testimonies are justice for ever: * give me understanding, and I shall live.
