God shall let me see over my enemies: slay them not, * lest at any time my people forget.
Scatter them by thy power; * and bring them down, O Lord, my protector:
For the sin of their mouth, and the word of their lips: * and let them be taken in their pride.
And for their cursing and lying they shall be talked of, when they are consumed: * when they are consumed by thy wrath, and they shall be no more.
And they shall know that God will rule Jacob, * and all the ends of the earth.
They shall return at evening and shall suffer hunger like dogs: * and shall go round about the city.
They shall be scattered abroad to eat, * and shall murmur if they be not filled.
But I will sing thy strength: * and will extol thy mercy in the morning.
For thou art become my support, * and my refuge, in the day of my trouble.
Unto thee, O my helper, will I sing, for thou art God my defence: * my God my mercy.
