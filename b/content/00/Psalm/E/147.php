Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: *â€¡ praise thy God, O Sion.
Because he hath strengthened the bolts of thy gates, * he hath blessed thy children within thee.
Who hath placed peace in thy borders: * and filleth thee with the fat of corn.
Who sendeth forth his speech to the earth: * his word runneth swiftly.
Who giveth snow like wool: * scattereth mists like ashes.
He sendeth his crystal like morsels: * who shall stand before the face of his cold?
He shall send out his word, and shall melt them: * his wind shall blow, and the waters shall run.
Who declareth his word to Jacob: * his justices and his judgments to Israel.
He hath not done in like manner to every nation: * and his judgments he hath not made manifest to them.
