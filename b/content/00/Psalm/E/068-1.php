Save me, O God: * for the waters are come in even unto my soul.â€¡
I stick fast in the mire of the deep: * and there is no sure standing. 
I am come into the depth of the sea: * and a tempest hath overwhelmed me. 
I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse: * my eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God. 
They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, * who hate me without cause. 
My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully persecuted me: * then did I pay that which I took not away. 
O God, thou knowest my foolishness; * and my offences are not hidden from thee.
Let not them be ashamed for me, who look for thee, O Lord, * the Lord of hosts. 
Let them not be confounded on my account, * who seek thee, O God of Israel. 
Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; * shame hath covered my face. 
I am become a stranger to my brethren, * and an alien to the sons of my mother. 
For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: * and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. 
And I covered my soul in fasting: * and it was made a reproach to me. 
And I made haircloth my garment: and I became a byword to them. 
They that sat in the gate spoke against me: * and they that drank wine made me their song. 
But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord; * for the time of thy good pleasure, O God.
