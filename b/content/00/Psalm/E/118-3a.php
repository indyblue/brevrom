He
Set before me for a law the way of thy justifications, O Lord: * and I will always seek after it.
Give me understanding, and I will search thy law; * and I will keep it with my whole heart.
Lead me into the path of thy commandments; * for this same I have desired.
Incline my heart into thy testimonies * and not to covetousness.
Turn away my eyes that they may not behold vanity: * quicken me in thy way.
Establish thy word to thy servant, * in thy fear.
Turn away my reproach, which I have apprehended: * for thy judgments are delightful.
Behold I have longed after thy precepts: * quicken me in thy justice.
