Psalm 72 ii
Therefore will my people return here * and full days shall be found in them.
And they said: How doth God know? * and is there knowledge in the most High?
Behold these are sinners; and yet abounding in the world * they have obtained riches.
And I said: Then have I in vain justified my heart, * and washed my hands among the innocent.
And I have been scourged all the day; * and my chastisement hath been in the mornings.
If I said: I will speak thus; * behold I should condemn the generation of thy children.
I studied that I might know this thing, * it is a labour in my sight:
Until I go into the sanctuary of God, * and understand concerning their last ends.
