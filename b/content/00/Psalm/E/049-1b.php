I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices: * and thy burnt offerings are always in my sight.
I will not take calves out of thy house: * nor he goats out of thy flocks.
For all the beasts of the woods are mine: * the cattle on the hills, and the oxen.
I know all the fowls of the air: * and with me is the beauty of the field.
If I should be hungry, I would not tell thee: * for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.
Shall I eat the flesh of bullocks? * or shall I drink the blood of goats?
Offer to God the sacrifice of praise: * and pay thy vows to the most High.
And call upon me in the day of trouble: * I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
