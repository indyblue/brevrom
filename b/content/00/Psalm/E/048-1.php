Psalm 48 i
Hear these things, all ye nations: * give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world.
All you that are earthborn, and you sons of men: * both rich and poor together.
My mouth shall speak wisdom: * and the meditation of my heart understanding.
I will incline my ear to a parable; * I will open my proposition on the psaltery.
Why shall I fear in the evil day? * the iniquity of my heel shall encompass me.
They that trust in their own strength, * and glory in the multitude of their riches,
No brother can redeem, nor shall man redeem: * he shall not give to God his ransom,
Nor the price of the redemption of his soul: * and shall labour for ever, and shall still live unto the end.
He shall not see destruction, when he shall see the wise dying: * the senseless and the fool shall perish together:
And they shall leave their riches to strangers: * and their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever.
Their dwelling places to all generations: * they have called their lands by their names.
And man when he was in honour did not understand; * he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to them.
