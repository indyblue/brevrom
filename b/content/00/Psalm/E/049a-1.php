Psalmus 49 i. Deus deórum
The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken: *‡ and he hath called the earth.
From the rising of the sun, to the going down thereof: * out of Sion the loveliness of his beauty.
God shall come manifestly: our God shall come, * and shall not keep silence.
A fire shall burn before him: * and a mighty tempest shall be round about him.
He shall call heaven from above, * and the earth, to judge his people.
Gather ye together his saints to him: * who set his covenant before sacrifices.
And the heavens shall declare his justice: * for God is judge.
Hear, O my people, and I will speak: O Israel, and I will testify to thee: * I am God, thy God.
I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices: * and thy burnt offerings are always in my sight.
I will not take calves out of thy house: * nor he goats out of thy flocks.
For all the beasts of the woods are mine: * the cattle on the hills, and the oxen.
I know all the fowls of the air: * and with me is the beauty of the field.
If I should be hungry, I would not tell thee: * for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.
Shall I eat the flesh of bullocks? * or shall I drink the blood of goats?
Offer to God the sacrifice of praise: * and pay thy vows to the most High.
And call upon me in the day of trouble: * I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
