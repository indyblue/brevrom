Aleph
Blessed are the undefiled in the way, * who walk in the law of the Lord.
Blessed are they that search his testimonies: * that seek him with their whole heart.
For they that work iniquity, * have not walked in his ways.
Thou hast commanded * thy commandments to be kept most diligently.
O! that my ways may be directed * to keep thy justifications.
Then shall I not be confounded, * when I shall look into all thy commandments.
I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, * when I shall have learned the judgments of thy justice.
I will keep thy justifications: * O! do not thou utterly forsake me.
