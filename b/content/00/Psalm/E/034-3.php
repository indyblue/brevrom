I will give thanks to thee in a great church; * I will praise thee in a strong people.
Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: * who have hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes.
For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; * and speaking in the anger of the earth they devised guile.
And they opened their mouth wide against me; * they said: Well done, well done, our eyes have seen it.
Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent: * O Lord, depart not from me.
Arise, and be attentive to my judgment: * to my cause, my God, and my Lord.
Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, * and let them not rejoice over me.
Let them not say in their hearts: It is well, it is well, to our mind: * neither let them say: We have swallowed him up.
Let them blush: and be ashamed together, * who rejoice at my evils.
Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, * who speak great things against me.
Let them rejoice and be glad, who are well pleased with my justice, * and let them say always: The Lord be magnified, who delights in the peace of his servant.
And my tongue shall meditate thy justice, * thy praise all the day long.
