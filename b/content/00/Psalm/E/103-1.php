Psalmus 103 i. Bénedic, ánima mea
Bless the Lord, O my soul: * O Lord my God, thou art exceedingly great.
Thou hast put on praise and beauty: * and art clothed with light as with a garment.
Who stretchest out the heaven like a pavilion: * who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water.
Who makest the clouds thy chariot: * who walkest upon the wings of the winds.
Who makest thy angels spirits: * and thy ministers a burning fire.
Who hast founded the earth upon its own bases: * it shall not be moved for ever and ever.
The deep like a garment is its clothing: * above the mountains shall the waters stand.
At thy rebuke they shall flee: * at the voice of thy thunder they shall fear.
The mountains ascend, and the plains descend * into the place which thou hast founded for them.
Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over; * neither shall they return to cover the earth.
Thou sendest forth springs in the vales: * between the midst of the hills the waters shall pass.
All the beasts of the field shall drink: * the wild asses shall expect in their thirst.
Over them the birds of the air shall dwell: * from the midst of the rocks they shall give forth their voices.
