Psalm 118 vi
~Caph
My soul hath fainted after thy salvation: * and in thy word I have very much hoped.
My eyes have failed for thy word, * saying: When wilt thou comfort me?
For I am become like a bottle in the frost: * I have not forgotten thy justifications.
How many are the days of thy servant: * when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
The wicked have told me fables: * but not as thy law.
All thy statutes are truth: * they have persecuted me unjustly, do thou help me.
They had almost made an end of me upon earth: * but I have not forsaken thy commandments.
Quicken thou me according to thy mercy: * and I shall keep the testimonies of thy mouth.
~Lam√©d
For ever, O Lord, * thy word standeth firm in heaven.
Thy truth unto all generations: * thou hast founded the earth, and it continueth.
By thy ordinance the day goeth on: * for all things serve thee.
Unless thy law had been my meditation, * I had then perhaps perished in my abjection.
Thy justifications I will never forget: * for by them thou hast given me life.
I am thine, save thou me: * for I have sought thy justifications.
The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: * but I have understood thy testimonies.
I have seen an end of all perfection: * thy commandment is exceeding broad.
