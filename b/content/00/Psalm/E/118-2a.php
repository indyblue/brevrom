Ghimel
Give bountifully to thy servant, enliven me: * and I shall keep thy words.
Open thou my eyes: * and I will consider the wondrous things of thy law.
I am a sojourner on the earth: * hide not thy commandments from me.
My soul hath coveted to long for thy justifications, * at all times.
Thou hast rebuked the proud: * they are cursed who decline from thy commandments.
Remove from me reproach and contempt: * because I have sought after thy testimonies.
For princes sat, and spoke against me: * but thy servant was employed in thy justifications.
For thy testimonies are my meditation: * and thy justifications my counsel.
