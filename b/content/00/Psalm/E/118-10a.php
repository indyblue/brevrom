Coph
I cried with my whole heart, hear me, O Lord: * I will seek thy justifications.
I cried unto thee, save me: * that I may keep thy commandments.
I prevented the dawning of the day, and cried: * because in thy words I very much hoped.
My eyes to thee have prevented the morning: * that I might meditate on thy words.
Hear thou my voice, O Lord, according to thy mercy: * and quicken me according to thy judgment.
They that persecute me have drawn nigh to iniquity; * but they are gone far off from thy law.
Thou art near, O Lord: * and all thy ways are truth.
I have known from the beginning concerning thy testimonies: * that thou hast founded them for ever.
