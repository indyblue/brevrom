Psalmus 77 v. Non sunt record√°ti
They remembered not his hand, * in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them:
How he wrought his signs in Egypt, * and his wonders in the field of Tanis.
And he turned their rivers into blood, * and their showers, that they might not drink.
He sent amongst them divers sorts of flies, which devoured them: * and frogs which destroyed them.
And he gave up their fruits to the blast, * and their labours to the locust.
And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, * and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost.
And he gave up their cattle to the hail, * and their stock to the fire.
And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: * indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.
He made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.
And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: * the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.
And he took away his own people as sheep: * and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: * and the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: * the mountain which his right hand had purchased.
And he cast out the Gentiles before them: * and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution.
And he made the tribes of Israel * to dwell in their tabernacles.
Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: * and they kept not his testimonies.
And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: * even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.
They provoked him to anger on their hills: * and moved him to jealousy with their graven things.
