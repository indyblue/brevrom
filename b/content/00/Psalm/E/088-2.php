Psalm 88 ii
Then thou spokest in a vision to thy saints, and saidst: * I have laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of my people.
I have found David my servant: * with my holy oil I have anointed him.
For my hand shall help him: * and my arm shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall have no advantage over him: * nor the son of iniquity have power to hurt him.
And I will cut down his enemies before his face; * and them that hate him I will put to flight.
And my truth and my mercy shall be with him: * and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
And I will set his hand in the sea; * and his right hand in the rivers.
He shall cry out to me: Thou art my father: * my God, and the support of my salvation.
And I will make him my firstborn, * high above the kings of the earth.
I will keep my mercy for him for ever: * and my covenant faithful to him.
And I will make his seed to endure for evermore: * and his throne as the days of heaven.
And if his children forsake my law, * and walk not in my judgments:
If they profane my justices: * and keep not my commandments:
I will visit their iniquities with a rod: * and their sins with stripes.
But my mercy I will not take away from him: * nor will I suffer my truth to fail.
Neither will I profane my covenant: * and the words that proceed from my mouth I will not make void.
Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David: * his seed shall endure for ever.
And his throne as the sun before me: * and as the moon perfect for ever, and a faithful witness in heaven.
