How good is God to Israel, * to them that are of a right heart!â€¡
But my feet were almost moved; * my steps had wellnigh slipped.
Because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, * seeing the prosperity of sinners.
For there is no regard to their death, * nor is there strength in their stripes.
They are not in the labour of men: * neither shall they be scourged like other men.
Therefore pride hath held them fast: * they are covered with their iniquity and their wickedness.
Their iniquity hath come forth, as it were from fatness: * they have passed into the affection of the heart.
They have thought and spoken wickedness: * they have spoken iniquity on high.
They have set their mouth against heaven: * and their tongue hath passed through the earth.
