Ye that fear the Lord, praise him: * all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him.
Let all the seed of Israel fear him: * because he hath not slighted nor despised the supplication of the poor man.
Neither hath he turned away his face from me: * and when I cried to him he heard me.
With thee is my praise in a great church: * I will pay my vows in the sight of them that fear him.
The poor shall eat and shall be filled: and they shall praise the Lord that seek him: * their hearts shall live for ever and ever.
All the ends of the earth * shall remember, and shall be converted to the Lord:
And all the kindreds of the Gentiles * shall adore in his sight.
For the kingdom is the Lordâ€™s; * and he shall have dominion over the nations.
All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored: * all they that go down to the earth shall fall before him.
And to him my soul shall live: * and my seed shall serve him.
There shall be declared to the Lord a generation to come: * and the heavens shall shew forth his justice to a people that shall be born, which the Lord hath made.
