Psalmus 118 ii. Retr√≠bue servo tuo
~Ghimel
Give bountifully to thy servant, enliven me: * and I shall keep thy words.
Open thou my eyes: * and I will consider the wondrous things of thy law.
I am a sojourner on the earth: * hide not thy commandments from me.
My soul hath coveted to long for thy justifications, * at all times.
Thou hast rebuked the proud: * they are cursed who decline from thy commandments.
Remove from me reproach and contempt: * because I have sought after thy testimonies.
For princes sat, and spoke against me: * but thy servant was employed in thy justifications.
For thy testimonies are my meditation: * and thy justifications my counsel.
~Daleth
My soul hath cleaved to the pavement: * quicken thou me according to thy word.
I have declared my ways, and thou hast heard me: * teach me thy justifications.
Make me to understand the way of thy justifications: * and I shall be exercised in thy wondrous works.
My soul hath slumbered through heaviness: * strengthen thou me in thy words.
Remove from me the way of iniquity: * and out of thy law have mercy on me.
I have chosen the way of truth: * thy judgments I have not forgotten.
I have stuck to thy testimonies, O Lord: * put me not to shame.
I have run the way of thy commandments, * when thou didst enlarge my heart.
