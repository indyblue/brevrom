Heth
O Lord, my portion, * I have said, I would keep thy law.
I entreated thy face with all my heart: * have mercy on me according to thy word.
I have thought on my ways: * and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
I am ready, and am not troubled: * that I may keep thy commandments.
The cords of the wicked have encompassed me: * but I have not forgotten thy law.
I rose at midnight to give praise to thee; * for the judgments of thy justification.
I am a partaker with all them that fear thee, * and that keep thy commandments.
The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy: * teach me thy justifications.
