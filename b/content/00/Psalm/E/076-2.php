Psalmus 76 ii. Deus, in sancto
Thy way, O God, is in the holy place: who is the great God like our God? * Thou art the God that dost wonders.
Thou hast made thy power known among the nations: * with thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of Jacob and of Joseph.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: * and they were afraid, and the depths were troubled.
Great was the noise of the waters: * the clouds sent out a sound.
For thy arrows pass: * the voice of thy thunder in a wheel.
Thy lightnings enlightened the world: * the earth shook and trembled.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: * and thy footsteps shall not be known.
Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, * by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
