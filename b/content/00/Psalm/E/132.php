Psalm 132
Behold how good and how pleasant it is * for brethren to dwell together in unity:â€¡
Like the precious ointment on the head, * that ran down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron,
Which ran down to the skirt of his garment: * as the dew of Hermon, which descendeth upon mount Sion.
For there the Lord hath commanded blessing, * and life for evermore.
