God is a just judge, strong and patient: * is he angry every day?
Except you will be converted, he will brandish his sword: * he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
And in it he hath prepared the instruments of death, * he hath made ready his arrows for them that burn.
Behold he hath been in labour with injustice; * he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.
He hath opened a pit and dug it: * and he is fallen into the hole he made.
His sorrow shall be turned on his own head: * and his iniquity shall come down upon his crown.
I will give glory to the Lord according to his justice: * and will sing to the name of the Lord the most High.
