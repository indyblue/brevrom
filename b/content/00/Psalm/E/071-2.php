Before him the Ethiopians shall fall down: * and his enemies shall lick the ground.
The kings of Tharsis and the islands shall offer presents: * the kings of the Arabians and of Saba shall bring gifts:
And all kings of the earth shall adore him: * all nations shall serve him.
For he shall deliver the poor from the mighty: * and the needy that had no helper.
He shall spare the poor and needy: * and he shall save the souls of the poor.
He shall redeem their souls from usuries and iniquity: * and their names shall be honourable in his sight.
And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Arabia, for him they shall always adore: * they shall bless him all the day.
And there shall be a firmament on the earth on the tops of mountains, above Libanus shall the fruit thereof be exalted: * and they of the city shall flourish like the grass of the earth.
Let his name be blessed for evermore: * his name continueth before the sun.
And in him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed: * all nations shall magnify him.
Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, * who alone doth wonderful things.
And blessed be the name of his majesty for ever: * and the whole earth shall be filled with his majesty. So be it. So be it.
