Psalm 104 ii
And he called a famine upon the land: * and he broke in pieces all the support of bread.
He sent a man before them: * Joseph, who was sold for a slave.
They humbled his feet in fetters: the iron pierced his soul, * until his word came.
The word of the Lord inflamed him: * the king sent, and he released him: the ruler of the people, and he set him at liberty.
He made him master of his house, * and ruler of all his possession.
That he might instruct his princes as himself, * and teach his ancients wisdom.
And Israel went into Egypt: * and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Cham.
And he increased his people exceedingly: * and strengthened them over their enemies,
He turned their heart to hate his people: * and to deal deceitfully with his servants.
He sent Moses his servant: * Aaron the man whom he had chosen.
He gave them power to shew his signs, * and his wonders in the land of Cham.
