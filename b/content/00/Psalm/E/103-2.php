Thou waterest the hills from thy upper rooms: * the earth shall be filled with the fruit of thy works:
Bringing forth grass for cattle, * and herb for the service of men.
That thou mayst bring bread out of the earth: * and that wine may cheer the heart of man.
That he may make the face cheerful with oil: * and that bread may strengthen manâ€™s heart.
The trees of the field shall be filled, and the cedars of Libanus which he hath planted: * there the sparrows shall make their nests.
The highest of them is the house of the heron. * The high hills are a refuge for the harts, the rock for the irchins.
He hath made the moon for seasons: * the sun knoweth his going down.
Thou hast appointed darkness, and it is night: * in it shall all the beasts of the woods go about:
The young lions roaring after their prey, * and seeking their meat from God.
The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together: * and they shall lie down in their dens.
Man shall go forth to his work, * and to his labour until the evening.
