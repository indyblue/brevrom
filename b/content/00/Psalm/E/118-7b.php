Nun
Thy word is a lamp to my feet, * and a light to my paths.
I have sworn and am determined * to keep the judgments of thy justice.
I have been humbled, O Lord, exceedingly: * quicken thou me according to thy word.
The free offerings of my mouth make acceptable, O Lord: * and teach me thy judgments.
My soul is continually in my hands: * and I have not forgotten thy law.
Sinners have laid a snare for me: * but I have not erred from thy precepts.
I have purchased thy testimonies for an inheritance for ever: * because they are the joy of my heart.
I have inclined my heart to do thy justifications for ever, * for the reward.
