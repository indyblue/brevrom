In all these things they sinned still: * and they believed not for his wondrous works.
And their days were consumed in vanity, * and their years in haste.
When he slew them, then they sought him: * and they returned, and came to him early in the morning.
And they remembered that God was their helper: * and the most high God their redeemer.
And they loved him with their mouth: and with their tongue they lied unto him:
But their heart was not right with him: * nor were they counted faithful in his covenant.
But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: * and will not destroy them.
And many a time did he turn away his anger: * and did not kindle all his wrath.
And he remembered that they are flesh: * a wind that goeth and returneth not.
How often did they provoke him in the desert: * and move him to wrath in the place without water?
And they turned back and tempted God: * and grieved the holy one of Israel.
