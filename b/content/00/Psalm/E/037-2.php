And they that were near me stood afar off: * and they that sought my soul used violence.
And they that sought evils to me spoke vain things, * and studied deceits all the day long.
But I, as a deaf man, heard not: * and as a dumb man not opening his mouth.
And I became as a man that heareth not: * and that hath no reproofs in his mouth.
For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped: * thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God.
For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me: * and whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me.
For I am ready for scourges: * and my sorrow is continually before me.
For I will declare my inequity: * and I will think for my sin.
But my enemies live, and are stronger that I: * and they hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
They that render evil for good, have detracted me, * because I followed goodness.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God: * do not thou depart from me.
Attend unto my help, * O Lord, the God of my salvation.
