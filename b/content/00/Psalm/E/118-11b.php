Tau
Let my supplication, O Lord, come near in thy sight: * give me understanding according to thy word.
Let my request come in before thee; * deliver thou me according to thy word.
My lips shall utter a hymn, * when thou shalt teach me thy justifications.
My tongue shall pronounce thy word: * because all thy commandments are justice.
Let thy hand be with me to save me; * for I have chosen thy precepts.
I have longed for thy salvation, O Lord; * and thy law is my meditation.
My soul shall live and shall praise thee: * and thy judgments shall help me.
I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost: * seek thy servant, because I have not forgotten thy commandments.
