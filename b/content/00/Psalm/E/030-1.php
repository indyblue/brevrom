Psalm 30 i
In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me never be confounded: * deliver me in thy justice.
Bow down thy ear to me: * make haste to deliver me.
Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a house of refuge, * to save me.
For thou art my strength and my refuge; * and for thy nameâ€™s sake thou wilt lead me, and nourish me.
Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hidden for me: * for thou art my protector.
Into thy hands I commend my spirit: * thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth.
Thou hast hated them that regard vanities, * to no purpose.
But I have hoped in the Lord: * I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy.
For thou hast regarded my humility, * thou hast saved my soul out of distresses.
And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy: * thou hast set my feet in a spacious place.
