Bless the Lord, O my soul: * and let all that is within me bless his holy name.
Bless the Lord, O my soul, * and never forget all he hath done for thee.
Who forgiveth all thy iniquities: * who healeth all thy diseases.
Who redeemeth thy life from destruction: * who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion.
Who satisfieth thy desire with good things: * thy youth shall be renewed like the eagleâ€™s.
The Lord doth mercies, * and judgment for all that suffer wrong.
He hath made his ways known to Moses: * his wills to the children of Israel.
The Lord is compassionate and merciful: * longsuffering and plenteous in mercy.
He will not always be angry: * nor will he threaten for ever.
He hath not dealt with us according to our sins: * nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
For according to the height of the heaven above the earth: * he hath strengthened his mercy towards them that fear him.
As far as the east is from the west, * so far hath he removed our iniquities from us.
