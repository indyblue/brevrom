Res
See my humiliation and deliver me: * for I have not forgotten thy law.
Judge my judgment and redeem me: * quicken thou me for thy wordâ€™s sake.
Salvation is far from sinners; * because they have not sought thy justifications.
Many, O Lord, are thy mercies: * quicken me according to thy judgment.
Many are they that persecute me, and afflict me; * but I have not declined from thy testimonies.
I beheld the transgressors, and I pined away; * because they kept not thy word.
Behold I have loved thy commandments, O Lord; * quicken me thou in thy mercy.
The beginning of thy words is truth: * all the judgments of thy justice are for ever.
