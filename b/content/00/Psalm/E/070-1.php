In thee, O Lord, I have hoped, let me never be put to confusion: * deliver me in thy justice, and rescue me.
Incline thy ear unto me, * and save me.
Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a place of strength: * that thou mayst make me safe.
For thou art my firmament * and my refuge.
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the sinner, * and out of the hand of the transgressor of the law and of the unjust.
For thou art my patience, O Lord: * my hope, O Lord, from my youth.
By thee have I been confirmed from the womb: * from my motherâ€™s womb thou art my protector.
Of thee shall I continually sing: * I am become unto many as a wonder, but thou art a strong helper.
Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may sing thy glory; * thy greatness all the day long.
Cast me not off in the time of old age: * when my strength shall fail, do not thou forsake me.
For my enemies have spoken against me; * and they that watched my soul have consulted together,
Saying: God hath forsaken him: pursue and take him, * for there is none to deliver him.
O God, be not thou far from me: * O my God, make haste to my help.
