Give glory to the Lord, and call upon his name: * declare his deeds among the Gentiles.
Sing to him, yea sing praises to him: * relate all his wondrous works.
Glory ye in his holy name: * let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
Seek ye the Lord, and be strengthened: * seek his face evermore.
Remember his marvellous works which he hath done; * his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.
O ye seed of Abraham his servant; * ye sons of Jacob his chosen.
He is the Lord our God: * his judgments are in all the earth.
He hath remembered his covenant for ever: * the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.
Which he made to Abraham; * and his oath to Isaac:
And he appointed the same to Jacob for a law, * and to Israel for an everlasting testament:
Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, * the lot of your inheritance.
When they were but a small number: * yea very few, and sojourners therein:
And they passed from nation to nation, * and from one kingdom to another people.
He suffered no man to hurt them: * and he reproved kings for their sakes.
Touch ye not my anointed: * and do no evil to my prophets.
