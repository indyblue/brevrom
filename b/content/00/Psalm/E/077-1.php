Attend, O my people, to my law: * incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in parables: * I will utter propositions from the beginning.
How great things have we heard and known, * and our fathers have told us.
They have not been hidden from their children, * in another generation.
Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, * and his wonders which he hath done.
And he set up a testimony in Jacob: * and made a law in Israel.
How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children: * that another generation might know them.
The children that should be born and should rise up, * and declare them to their children.
That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: * and may seek his commandments.
That they may not become like their fathers, * a perverse end exasperating generation.
A generation that set not their heart aright: * and whose spirit was not faithful to God.
