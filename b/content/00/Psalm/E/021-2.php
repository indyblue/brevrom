Many calves have surrounded me: * fat bulls have besieged me.
They have opened their mouths against me, * as a lion ravening and roaring.
I am poured out like water; * and all my bones are scattered.
My heart is become like wax melting * in the midst of my bowels.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue hath cleaved to my jaws: * and thou hast brought me down into the dust of death.
For many dogs have encompassed me: * the council of the malignant hath besieged me.
They have dug my hands and feet. * They have numbered all my bones.
And they have looked and stared upon me. * They parted my garments amongst them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.
But thou, O Lord, remove not thy help to a distance from me; * look towards my defence.
Deliver, O God, my soul from the sword: * my only one from the hand of the dog.
Save me from the lionâ€™s mouth; * and my lowness from the horns of the unicorns.
I will declare thy name to my brethren: * in the midst of the church will I praise thee.
