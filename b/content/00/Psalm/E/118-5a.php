Teth
Thou hast done well with thy servant, O Lord, * according to thy word.
Teach me goodness and discipline and knowledge; * for I have believed thy commandments.
Before I was humbled I offended; * therefore have I kept thy word.
Thou art good; * and in thy goodness teach me thy justifications.
The iniquity of the proud hath been multiplied over me: * but I will seek thy commandments with my whole heart.
Their heart is curdled like milk: * but I have meditated on thy law.
It is good for me that thou hast humbled me, * that I may learn thy justifications.
The law of thy mouth is good to me, * above thousands of gold and silver.
