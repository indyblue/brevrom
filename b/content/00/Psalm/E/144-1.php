I will extol thee, O God my king: * and I will bless thy name for ever; yea, for ever and ever.
Every day will I bless thee: * and I will praise thy name for ever; yea, for ever and ever.
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised: * and of his greatness there is no end.
Generation and generation shall praise thy works: * and they shall declare thy power.
They shall speak of the magnificence of the glory of thy holiness: * and shall tell thy wondrous works.
And they shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: * and shall declare thy greatness.
They shall publish the memory of the abundance of thy sweetness: * and shall rejoice in thy justice.
