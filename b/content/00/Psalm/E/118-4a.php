Zain
Be thou mindful of thy word to thy servant, * in which thou hast given me hope.
This hath comforted me in my humiliation: * because thy word hath enlivened me.
The proud did iniquitously altogether: * but I declined not from thy law.
I remembered, O Lord, thy judgments of old: * and I was comforted.
A fainting hath taken hold of me, * because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
Thy justifications were the subject of my song, * in the place of my pilgrimage.
In the night I have remembered thy name, O Lord: * and have kept thy law.
This happened to me: * because I sought after thy justifications.
