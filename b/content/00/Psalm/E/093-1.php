The Lord is the God to whom revenge belongeth: * the God of revenge hath acted freely.
Lift up thyself, thou that judgest the earth: * render a reward to the proud.
How long shall sinners, O Lord: * how long shall sinners glory?
Shall they utter, and speak iniquity: * shall all speak who work injustice?
Thy people, O Lord, they have brought low: * and they have afflicted thy inheritance.
They have slain the widow and the stranger: * and they have murdered the fatherless.
And they have said: The Lord shall not see: * neither shall the God of Jacob understand.
Understand, ye senseless among the people: * and, you fools, be wise at last.
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? * or he that formed the eye, doth he not consider?
He that chastiseth nations, shall he not rebuke: * he that teacheth man knowledge?
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, * that they are vain.
