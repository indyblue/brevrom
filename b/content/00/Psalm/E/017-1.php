Psalmus 17 i. Díligam te, Dómine
I will love thee, O Lord, my strength: * The Lord is my firmament, my refuge, and my deliverer.
My God is my helper, * and in him will I put my trust.
My protector, and the horn of my salvation, * and my support.
Praising, I will call upon the Lord: * and I shall be saved from my enemies.
The sorrows of death surrounded me: * and the torrents of iniquity troubled me.
The sorrows of hell encompassed me: * and the snares of death prevented me.
In my affliction I called upon the Lord, * and I cried to my God:
And he heard my voice from his holy temple: * and my cry before him came into his ears.
The earth shook and trembled: * the foundations of the mountains were troubled and were moved, because he was angry with them.
There went up a smoke in his wrath: and a fire flamed from his face: * coals were kindled by it.
He bowed the heavens, and came down, * and darkness was under his feet.
And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; * he flew upon the wings of the winds.
And he made darkness his covert, his pavilion round about him: * dark waters in the clouds of the air.
At the brightness that was before him the clouds passed, * hail and coals of fire.
And the Lord thundered from heaven, and the Highest gave his voice: * hail and coals of fire.
And he sent forth his arrows, and he scattered them: * he multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.
Then the fountains of waters appeared, * and the foundations of the world were discovered:
At thy rebuke, O Lord, * at the blast of the spirit of thy wrath.
