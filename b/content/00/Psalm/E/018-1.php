Psalm 18 i
The heavens shew forth the glory of God, * and the firmament declareth the work of his hands.
Day to day uttereth speech, * and night to night sheweth knowledge.
There are no speeches nor languages, * where their voices are not heard.
Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: * and their words unto the ends of the world.
He hath set his tabernacle in the sun: * and he, as a bridegroom coming out of his bride chamber,
Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way: * his going out is from the end of heaven,
And his circuit even to the end thereof: * and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.
