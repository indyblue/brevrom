Sin
Princes have persecuted me without cause: * and my heart hath been in awe of thy words.
I will rejoice at thy words, * as one that hath found great spoil.
I have hated and abhorred iniquity; * but I have loved thy law.
Seven times a day I have given praise to thee, * for the judgments of thy justice.
Much peace have they that love thy law, * and to them there is no stumbling-block.
I looked for thy salvation, O Lord: * and I loved thy commandments.
My soul hath kept thy testimonies: * and hath loved them exceedingly.
I have kept thy commandments and thy testimonies: * because all my ways are in thy sight.
