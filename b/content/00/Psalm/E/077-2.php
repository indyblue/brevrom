Psalmus 77 ii. Filii Ephrem
The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: * they have turned back in the day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God: * and in his law they would not walk.
And they forgot his benefits, * and his wonders that he had shewn them.
Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, * in the field of Tanis.
He divided the sea and brought them through: * and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel.
And he conducted them with a cloud by day: * and all the night with a light of fire.
He struck the rock in the wilderness: * and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep.
He brought forth water out of the rock: * and made streams run down as rivers.
