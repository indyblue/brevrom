Do thou deliver me, for I am poor and needy, * and my heart is troubled within me.
I am taken away like the shadow when it declineth: * and I am shaken off as locusts.
My knees are weakened through fasting: * and my flesh is changed for oil.
And I am become a reproach to them: * they saw me and they shaked their heads.
Help me, O Lord my God; * save me according to thy mercy.
And let them know that this is thy hand: * and that thou, O Lord, hast done it.
They will curse and thou wilt bless: * let them that rise up against me be confounded: but thy servant shall rejoice.
Let them that detract me be clothed with shame: * and let them be covered with their confusion as with a double cloak.
I will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth: * and in the midst of many I will praise him.
Because he hath stood at the right hand of the poor, * to save my soul from persecutors.
