Psalm 118 xi
~Sin
Princes have persecuted me without cause: * and my heart hath been in awe of thy words.
I will rejoice at thy words, * as one that hath found great spoil.
I have hated and abhorred iniquity; * but I have loved thy law.
Seven times a day I have given praise to thee, * for the judgments of thy justice.
Much peace have they that love thy law, * and to them there is no stumbling-block.
I looked for thy salvation, O Lord: * and I loved thy commandments.
My soul hath kept thy testimonies: * and hath loved them exceedingly.
I have kept thy commandments and thy testimonies: * because all my ways are in thy sight.
~Tau
Let my supplication, O Lord, come near in thy sight: * give me understanding according to thy word.
Let my request come in before thee; * deliver thou me according to thy word.
My lips shall utter a hymn, * when thou shalt teach me thy justifications.
My tongue shall pronounce thy word: * because all thy commandments are justice.
Let thy hand be with me to save me; * for I have chosen thy precepts.
I have longed for thy salvation, O Lord; * and thy law is my meditation.
My soul shall live and shall praise thee: * and thy judgments shall help me.
I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost: * seek thy servant, because I have not forgotten thy commandments.
