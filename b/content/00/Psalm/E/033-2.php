Come, children, hearken to me: * I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
Who is the man that desireth life: * who loveth to see good days?
Keep thy tongue from evil, * and thy lips from speaking guile.
Turn away from evil and do good: * seek after peace and pursue it.
The eyes of the Lord are upon the just: * and his ears unto their prayers.
But the countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil things: * to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
The just cried, and the Lord heard them: * and delivered them out of all their troubles.
The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: * and he will save the humble of spirit.
Many are the afflictions of the just; * but out of them all will the Lord deliver them.
The Lord keepeth all their bones, * not one of them shall be broken.
The death of the wicked is very evil: * and they that hate the just shall be guilty.
The Lord will redeem the souls of his servants: * and none of them that trust in him shall offend.
