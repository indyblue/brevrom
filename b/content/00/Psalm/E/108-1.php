Psalm 108 i
O God, be not thou silent in my praise: * for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me.
They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues; and they have compassed me about with words of hatred; * and have fought against me without cause.
Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me: * but I gave myself to prayer.
And they repaid me evil for good: * and hatred for my love.
Set thou the sinner over him: * and may the devil stand at his right hand.
When he is judged, may he go out condemned; * and may his prayer be turned to sin.
May his days be few: * and his bishopric let another take.
May his children be fatherless, * and his wife a widow.
Let his children be carried about vagabonds, and beg; * and let them be cast out of their dwellings.
May the usurer search all his substance: * and let strangers plunder his labours.
May there be none to help him: * nor none to pity his fatherless offspring.
May his posterity be cut off; * in one generation may his name be blotted out.
