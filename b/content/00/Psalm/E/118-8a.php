Samech
I have hated the unjust: * and have loved thy law.
Thou art my helper and my protector: * and in thy word I have greatly hoped.
Depart from me, ye malignant: * and I will search the commandments of my God.
Uphold me according to thy word, and I shall live: * and let me not be confounded in my expectation.
Help me, and I shall be saved: * and I will meditate always on thy justifications.
Thou hast despised all them that fall off from thy judgments; * for their thought is unjust.
I have accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators: * therefore have I loved thy testimonies.
Pierce thou my flesh with thy fear: * for I am afraid of thy judgments.
