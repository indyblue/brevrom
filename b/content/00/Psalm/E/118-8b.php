Ain
I have done judgment and justice: * give me not up to them that slander me.
Uphold thy servant unto good: * let not the proud calumniate me.
My eyes have fainted after thy salvation: * and for the word of thy justice.
Deal with thy servant according to thy mercy: * and teach me thy justifications.
I am thy servant: * give me understanding that I may know thy testimonies.
It is time, O Lord, to do: * they have dissipated thy law.
Therefore have I loved thy commandments * above gold and the topaz.
Therefore was I directed to all thy commandments: * I have hated all wicked ways.
