Give ear, O thou that rulest Israel: * thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep.
Thou that sittest upon the cherubims, * shine forth before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses.
Stir up thy might, and come * to save us.
Convert us, O God: * and shew us thy face, and we shall be saved.
O Lord God of hosts, * how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy servant?
How long wilt thou feed us with the bread of tears: * and give us for our drink tears in measure?
Thou hast made us to be a contradiction to our neighbours: * and our enemies have scoffed at us.
O God of hosts, convert us: * and shew thy face, and we shall be saved.
