Psalm 104 iii
He sent darkness, and made it obscure: * and grieved not his words.
He turned their waters into blood, * and destroyed their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs, * in the inner chambers of their kings.
He spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies, * and sciniphs in all their coasts.
He gave them hail for rain, * a burning fire in the land.
And he destroyed their vineyards, and their fig trees: * and he broke in pieces the trees of their coasts.
He spoke, and the locust came, and the bruchus, * of which there was no number.
And they devoured all the grass in their land, * and consumed all the fruit of their ground.
And he slew all the firstborn in their land: * the firstfruits of all their labour.
And he brought them out with silver and gold: * and there was not among their tribes one that was feeble.
Egypt was glad when they departed: * for the fear of them lay upon them.
He spread a cloud for their protection, * and fire to give them light in the night.
They asked, and the quail came: * and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock, and waters flowed: * rivers ran down in the dry land.
Because he remembered his holy word, * which he had spoken to his servant Abraham.
And he brought forth his people with joy, * and his chosen with gladness.
And he gave them the lands of the Gentiles: * and they possessed the labours of the people:
That they might observe his justifications, * and seek after his law.
