Psalm 9 i
I will give praise to thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: * I will relate all thy wonders.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: * I will sing to thy name, O thou most High,
When my enemy shall be turned back: * they shall be weakened and perish before thy face.
For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause: * thou hast sat on the throne, who judgest justice.
Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and the wicked one hath perished: * thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.
The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: * and their cities thou hast destroyed.
Their memory hath perished with a noise: * but the Lord remaineth for ever.
He hath prepared his throne in judgment: * and he shall judge the world in equity, he shall judge the peoples in justice.
And the Lord is become a refuge for the poor: * a helper in due time in tribulation.
And let them trust in thee who know thy name: * for thou hast not forsaken them that seek thee, O Lord.
