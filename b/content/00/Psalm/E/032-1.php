Rejoice in the Lord, O ye just: * praise becometh the upright.
Give praise to the Lord on the harp; * sing to him with the psaltery, the instrument of ten strings.
Sing to him a new canticle, * sing well unto him with a loud noise.
For the word of the Lord is right, * and all his works are done with faithfulness.
He loveth mercy and judgment; * the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.
By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; * and all the power of them by the spirit of his mouth:
Gathering together the waters of the sea, as in a vessel; * laying up the depths in storehouses.
Let all the earth fear the Lord, * and let all the inhabitants of the world be in awe of him.
For he spoke and they were made: * he commanded and they were created.
The Lord bringeth to nought the counsels of nations; * and he rejecteth the devices of people, and casteth away the counsels of princes.
But the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever: * the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
