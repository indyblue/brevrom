Vau
Let thy mercy also come upon me, O Lord: * thy salvation according to thy word.
So shall I answer them that reproach me in any thing; * that I have trusted in thy words.
And take not thou the word of truth utterly out of my mouth: * for in thy words, I have hoped exceedingly.
So shall I always keep thy law, * for ever and ever.
And I walked at large: * because I have sought after thy commandments.
And I spoke of thy testimonies before kings: * and I was not ashamed.
I meditated also on thy commandments, * which I loved.
And I lifted up my hands to thy commandments, which I loved: * and I was exercised in thy justifications.
