Psalm 118 v (Teth, Jod)
Thou hast done well with thy servant, O Lord, * according to thy word.
Teach me goodness and discipline and knowledge; * for I have believed thy commandments.
Before I was humbled I offended; * therefore have I kept thy word.
Thou art good; * and in thy goodness teach me thy justifications.
The iniquity of the proud hath been multiplied over me: * but I will seek thy commandments with my whole heart.
Their heart is curdled like milk: * but I have meditated on thy law.
It is good for me that thou hast humbled me, * that I may learn thy justifications.
The law of thy mouth is good to me, * above thousands of gold and silver.
Thy hands have made me and formed me: * give me understanding, and I will learn thy commandments.
They that fear thee shall see me, and shall be glad: * because I have greatly hoped in thy words.
I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are equity: * and in thy truth thou hast humbled me.
O! let thy mercy be for my comfort, * according to thy word unto thy servant.
Let thy tender mercies come unto me, and I shall live: * for thy law is my meditation.
Let the proud be ashamed, because they have done unjustly towards me: * but I will be employed in thy commandments.
Let them that fear thee turn to me: * and they that know thy testimonies.
Let my heart be undefiled in thy justifications, * that I may not be confounded.
