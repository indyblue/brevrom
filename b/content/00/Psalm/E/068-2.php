In the multitude of thy mercy hear me, * in the truth of thy salvation.
Draw me out of the mire, that I may not stick fast: * deliver me from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Let not the tempest of water drown me, nor the deep swallow me up: * and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Hear me, O Lord, for thy mercy is kind; * look upon me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
And turn not away thy face from thy servant: * for I am in trouble, hear me speedily.
Attend to my soul, and deliver it: * save me because of my enemies.
Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, * and my shame.
In thy sight are all they that afflict me; * my heart hath expected reproach and misery.
And I looked for one that would grieve together with me, * but there was none: and for one that would comfort me, and I found none.
And they gave me gall for my food, * and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let their table become as a snare before them, * and a recompense, and a stumblingblock.
Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; * and their back bend thou down always.
Pour out thy indignation upon them: * and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
Let their habitation be made desolate: * and let there be none to dwell in their tabernacles.
Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; * and they have added to the grief of my wounds.
Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity: * and let them not come into thy justice.
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; * and with the just let them not be written.
