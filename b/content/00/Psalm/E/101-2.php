For the stones thereof have pleased thy servants: * and they shall have pity on the earth thereof.
And the Gentiles shall fear thy name, O Lord, * and all the kings of the earth thy glory.
For the Lord hath built up Sion: * and he shall be seen in his glory.
He hath had regard to the prayer of the humble: * and he hath not despised their petition.
Let these things be written unto another generation: * and the people that shall be created shall praise the Lord:
Because he hath looked forth from his high sanctuary: * from heaven the Lord hath looked upon the earth.
That he might hear the groans of them that are in fetters: * that he might release the children of the slain:
That they may declare the name of the Lord in Sion: * and his praise in Jerusalem;
When the people assemble together, * and kings, to serve the Lord.
