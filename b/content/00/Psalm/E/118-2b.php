Daleth
My soul hath cleaved to the pavement: * quicken thou me according to thy word.
I have declared my ways, and thou hast heard me: * teach me thy justifications.
Make me to understand the way of thy justifications: * and I shall be exercised in thy wondrous works.
My soul hath slumbered through heaviness: * strengthen thou me in thy words.
Remove from me the way of iniquity: * and out of thy law have mercy on me.
I have chosen the way of truth: * thy judgments I have not forgotten.
I have stuck to thy testimonies, O Lord: * put me not to shame.
I have run the way of thy commandments, * when thou didst enlarge my heart.
