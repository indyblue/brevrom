Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thy ear: * and forget thy people and thy father&apos;s house.
And the king shall greatly desire thy beauty; * for he is the Lord thy God, and him they shall adore.
And the daughters of Tyre with gifts, * yea, all the rich among the people, shall entreat thy countenance.
All the glory of the king&apos;s daughter is within, * in golden borders, clothed round about with varieties.
After her shall virgins be brought to the king: * her neighbours shall be brought to thee.
They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing: * they shall be brought into the temple of the king.
Instead of thy fathers, sons are born to thee: * thou shalt make them princes over all the earth.
They shall remember thy name * throughout all generations.
Therefore shall people praise thee for ever; yea, * for ever and ever.
