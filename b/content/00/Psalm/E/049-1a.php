The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken: *â€¡ and he hath called the earth.
From the rising of the sun, to the going down thereof: * out of Sion the loveliness of his beauty.
God shall come manifestly: our God shall come, * and shall not keep silence.
A fire shall burn before him: * and a mighty tempest shall be round about him.
He shall call heaven from above, * and the earth, to judge his people.
Gather ye together his saints to him: * who set his covenant before sacrifices.
And the heavens shall declare his justice: * for God is judge.
