I Thess. 4:1
Fratres: Rogámus vos, et obsecrámus in Dómino Jesu: ut, quemádmodum accepístis a nobis, quómodo vos opórteat ambuláre, et placére Deo, sic et ambulétis, ut abundétis magis.
Brethren: We pray and beseech you in the Lord Jesus: that as you have received of us how you ought to walk, and to please God, so also you would walk, that you may abound the more.
