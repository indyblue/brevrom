Acts 9:8-9
Surréxit autem Saulus de terra, apertísque óculis nihil vidébat. Ad manus autem illum trahéntes, introduxérunt Damáscum. Et erat ibi tribus diébus non videns, et non manducávit, neque bibit.
And Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. But they leading him by the hands, brought him to Damascus. And he was there three days, without sight, and he did neither eat nor drink.
