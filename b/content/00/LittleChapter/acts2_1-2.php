Acts 2:1-2
Cum compleréntur dies Pentecóstes, erant omnes discípuli páriter in eódem loco: et factus est repénte de cælo sonus, tamquam adveniéntis spíritus veheméntis, et replévit totam domum, ubi erant sedéntes.
When the days of Pentecost were accomplished, they were all together in one place: and suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
