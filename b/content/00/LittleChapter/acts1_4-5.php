Acts 1:4-5
Et convéscens, præcépit eis, ab Jerosólymis ne discéderent, sed exspectárent promissiónem Patris, quam audístis (inquit) per os meum: quia Joánnes quidem baptizávit aqua, vos autem baptizabímini Spíritu Sancto non post multos hos dies.
And eating together with them, he commanded them, that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but should wait for the promise of the Father, which you have heard (saith he) by my mouth: For John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence.
