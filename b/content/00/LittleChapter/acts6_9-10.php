Acts 6:9-10
Surrexérunt autem quidam de synagóga, quæ appellátur Libertinórum, et Cyrenénsium, et Alexandrinórum, et eórum qui erant a Cilícia, et Ásia, disputántes cum Stéphano: et non póterant resístere sapiéntiæ, et Spirítui qui loquebátur.
Now there arose some of that which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them that were of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen: and they were not able to resist the wisdom, and the Spirit that spoke.
