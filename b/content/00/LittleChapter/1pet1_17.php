I Peter 1:17
In timóre incolátus vestri témpore conversámini: sciéntes quod non corruptibílibus auro vel argénto redémpti estis, sed pretióso sánguine quasi Agni immaculáti Christi.
Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear; forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.
