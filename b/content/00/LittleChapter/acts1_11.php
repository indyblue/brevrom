Acts 1:11
Viri Galilǽi, quid statis aspiciéntes in cælum? Hic Jesus qui assúmptus est a vobis in cælum, sic véniet, quemádmodum vidístis eum eúntem in cælum.
Ye men of Galilee, why stand you looking up to heaven? This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, as you have seen him going into heaven.
