II Cor. 9:8-9
Potens est autem Deus omnem grátiam abundáre fácere in vobis, ut, in ómnibus semper omnem sufficiéntiam habéntes, abundétis in omne opus bonum, sicut scriptum est: Dispérsit, dedit paupéribus: justítia ejus manet in sǽculum sǽculi.
And God is able to make all grace abound in you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work, as it is written: He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor, his justice remaineth for ever.
