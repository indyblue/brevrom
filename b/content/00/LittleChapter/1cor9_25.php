I Cor. 9:25
Omnis autem, qui in agóne conténdit, ab ómnibus se ábstinet: et illi quidem ut corruptíbilem corónam accípiant, nos autem incorrúptam.
And every one that striveth for the mastery, refraineth himself from all things: and they indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible one.
