Apoc. 12:7
Factum est prǽlium magnum in cælo: Míchaël et Ángeli ejus præliabántur cum dracóne, et draco pugnábat et ángeli ejus: et non prævaluérunt, neque locus invéntus est eórum ámplius in cælo.
And there was a great battle in heaven, Michael and his Angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought, and his angels, and they prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven.
