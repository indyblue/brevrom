Acts 9:1-2
Saulus adhuc spirans minárum et cædis in discípulos Dómini, accéssit ad príncipem sacerdótum, et pétiit ab eo epístolas in Damáscum ad synagógas; ut si quos invenísset hujus viæ viros ac mulíeres, vinctos perdúceret in Jerúsalem.
Saul, as yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest, and asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues; that if he found any men and women of this way, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
