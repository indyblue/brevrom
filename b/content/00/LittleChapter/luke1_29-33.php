Luke 1:29-33
Quæ cum audísset, turbáta est in sermóne ejus, et cogitábat qualis esset ista salutátio. Et ait Ángelus ei: Ne tímeas, María; invenísti enim grátiam apud Deum: ecce concípies in útero, et páries fílium, et vocábis nomen ejus Jesum. Hic erit magnus, et Fílius Altíssimi vocábitur; et dabit illi Dóminus Deus sedem David, patris ejus; et regnábit in domo Jacob in ætérnum, et regni ejus non erit finis.
Who having heard, was troubled at his saying, and thought with herself what manner of salutation this should be. And the Angel said to her: Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found grace with God: behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the most High; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David, his father; and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
