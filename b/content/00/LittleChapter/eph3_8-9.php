Eph. 3:8-9
Fratres: Mihi ómnium sanctórum mínimo data est grátia hæc, in géntibus evangelizáre investigábiles divítias Christi; et illumináre omnes, quæ sit dispensátio sacraménti abscónditi a sǽculis in Deo.
Brethren: To me, the least of all the saints, is given this grace, to preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; and to enlighten all men, that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God.
