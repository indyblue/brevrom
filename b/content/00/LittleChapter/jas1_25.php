James 1:25
Qui autem perspéxerit in legem perféctam libertátis, et permánserit in ea, non audítor obliviósus factus, sed factor óperis: hic beátus in facto suo erit.
But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty, and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; this man shall be blessed in his deed.
