Acts 12:11
Et Petrus ad se revérsus dixit: Nunc scio vere quia misit Dóminus Ángelum suum, et erípuit me de manu Heródis et de omni exspectatióne plebis Judæórum.
And Peter coming to himself, said: Now I know in very deed, that the Lord hath sent his Angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
