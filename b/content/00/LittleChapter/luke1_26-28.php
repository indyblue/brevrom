Luke 1:26-28
Missus est Ángelus Gábriel a Deo in civitátem Galilǽæ, cui nomen Názareth, ad vírginem desponsátam viro, cui nomen erat Joseph, de domo David, et nomen vírginis María. Et ingréssus Ángelus ad eam, dixit: Ave, grátia plena; Dóminus tecum: benedícta tu in muliéribus.
The Angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. And the Angel being come in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace; the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
