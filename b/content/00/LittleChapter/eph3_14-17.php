Eph. 3:14-17
Hujus rei grátia flecto génua mea ad Patrem Dómini nostri Jesu Christi, ut det vobis secúndum divítias glóriæ suæ virtúte corroborári per Spíritum ejus in interiórem hóminem: Christum habitáre per fidem in córdibus vestris.
For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened by his Spirit with might unto the inward man: that Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts.
