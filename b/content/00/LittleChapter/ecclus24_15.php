Ecclus. (Sir.) 24:15
Et sic in Sion firmáta sum, et in civitáte sanctificáta simíliter requiévi, et in Jerúsalem potéstas mea. Et radicávi in pópulo honorificáto, et in parte Dei mei heréditas illíus, et in plenitúdine sanctórum deténtio mea.
And so was I established in Sion, and in the holy city likewise I rested, and my power was in Jerusalem. And I took root in an honourable people, and in the portion of my God his inheritance, and my abode is in the full assembly of saints.
