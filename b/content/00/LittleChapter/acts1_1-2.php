Acts 1:1-2
Primum quidem sermónem feci de ómnibus, o Theóphile, quæ cœpit Jesus fácere et docére usque in diem, qua præcípiens Apóstolis per Spíritum Sanctum, quos elégit assúmptus est.
The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, of all things which Jesus began to do and to teach, until the day on which, giving commandments by the Holy Ghost to the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up.
