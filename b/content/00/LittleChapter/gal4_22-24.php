Gal 4:22-24
Fratres: Scriptum est, quóniam Ábraham duos fílios hábuit: unum de ancílla, et unum de líbera: sed qui de ancílla, secúndum carnem natus est: qui autem de líbera, per repromissiónem: quæ sunt per allegoríam dicta.
Brethren: It is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bond-woman, and the other by a free-woman: but he who was of the bond-woman, was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman was by promise: which things are said by an allegory.
