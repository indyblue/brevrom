Ecclus. (Sir.) 24:14
Ab inítio et ante sǽcula creáta sum, et usque ad futúrum sǽculum non désinam, et in habitatióne sancta coram ipso ministrávi.
From the beginning, and before the world, was I created, and unto the world to come I shall not cease to be, and in the holy dwelling place I have ministered before him.
