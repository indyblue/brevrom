Ecclus. 31:8
BEÁTUS vir, qui invéntus est sine mácula, et qui post aurum non ábiit, nec sperávit in pecúnia et thesáuris. Quis est hic, et laudábimus eum? fecit enim mirabília in vita sua.
BLESSED is the man that is found without blemish: and that hath not gone after gold, nor put his trust in money nor in treasures. Who is he, and we will praise him? for he hath done wonderful things in his life.
