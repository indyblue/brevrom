Job 14:1-6
Homo natus de mulíere, brevi vivens témpore, replétur multis misériis. Qui quasi flos egréditur et contéritur, et fugit velut umbra, et numquam in eódem statu pérmanet. Et dignum ducis super hujuscémodi aperíre óculos tuos, et addúcere eum tecum in judícium? Quis potest fácere mundum de immúndo concéptum sémine? Nonne tu qui solus es? Breves dies hóminis sunt, númerus ménsium ejus apud te est: constituísti términos ejus, qui præteríri non póterunt. Recéde páululum ab eo, ut quiéscat, donec optáta véniat, sicut mercenárii, dies ejus.
Man born of a woman, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries. Who cometh forth like a flower, and is destroyed, and fleeth as a shadow, and never continueth in the same state. And dost thou think it meet to open thy eyes upon such an one, and to bring him into judgment with thee? Who can make him clean that is conceived of unclean seed? is it not thou who only art? The days of man are short, and the number of his months is with thee: thou hast appointed his bounds which cannot be passed. Depart a little from him, that he may rest, until his wished for day come, as that of the hireling.
