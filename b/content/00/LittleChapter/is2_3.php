Is. 2:3
Veníte, et ascendámus ad montem Dómini, et ad domum Dei Jacob, et docébit nos vias suas, et ambulábimus in sémitis ejus: quia de Sion exíbit lex, et verbum Dómini de Jerúsalem.
Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall come forth from Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
