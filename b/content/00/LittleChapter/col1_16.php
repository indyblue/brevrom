Col. 1:16-18
OMNIA per ipsum et in ipso creáta sunt, et ipse est ante omnes, et ómnia in ipso constant. Et ipse est caput córporis Ecclésiæ, qui est princípium, primogénitus ex mórtuis, ut sit in ómnibus ipse primátum tenens.
ALL things were created by him and in him, and he is before all, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the Church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he may hold the primacy.
