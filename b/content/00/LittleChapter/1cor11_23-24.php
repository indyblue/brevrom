I Cor. 11:23-24
Fratres: Ego enim accépi a Dómino quod et trádidi vobis, quóniam Dóminus Jesus, in qua nocte tradebátur, accépit panem, et grátias agens fregit, et dixit: Accípite et manducáte: hoc est corpus meum, quod pro vobis tradétur: hoc fácite in meam commemoratiónem.
Brethren: For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me.
