Gal 4:4-5
At ubi venit plenitúdo témporis, misit Deus Fílium suum factum ex mulíere, factum sub lege, ut eos, qui sub lege erant, redímeret, ut adoptiónem filiórum reciperémus.
But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law; that he might redeem them who were under the law; that we might receive the adoption of sons.
