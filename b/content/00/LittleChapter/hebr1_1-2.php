Hebr. 1:1-2
Multifáriam, multísque modis olim Deus loquens pátribus in prophétis: novíssime diébus istis locútus est nobis in Fílio, quem constítuit herédem universórum, per quem fecit et sǽcula.
God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets: last of all, in these days hath spoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world.
