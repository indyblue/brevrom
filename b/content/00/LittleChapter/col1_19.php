Col. 1:19-20
IN ipso complácuit omnem plenitúdinem inhabitáre, et per eum reconciliáre ómnia in ipsum, pacíficans per sánguinem crucis ejus sive quæ in terris, sive quæ in cælis sunt, in Christo Jesu Dómino nostro.
IN him, it hath well pleased the Father, that all fullness should dwell, and through him to reconcile all things unto himself, making peace through the blood of his cross, both as to the things that are on earth, and the things that are in heaven, in Christ Jesus our Lord.
