2 Tim. 4:7-8
Bonum certámen certávi, cursum consummávi, fidem servávi.  In relíquo repósita est mihi coróna justítiæ, quam reddet mihi Dóminus in illa die justus judex.
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day.
