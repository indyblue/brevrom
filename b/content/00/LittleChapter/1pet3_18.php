I Peter 3:18
Christus semel pro peccátis nostris mórtuus est, justus pro injústis, ut nos offérret Deo, mortificátus quidem carne, vivificátus autem spíritu.
Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust, that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit.
