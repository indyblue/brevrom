Ecclus. 24:25,39:17
In me grátia omnis viæ et veritátis, in me omnis spes vitæ et virtútis. Ego, quasi rosa plantáta super rivos aquárum, fructificávi.
In me is all grace of the way and of the truth; in me is all hope of life and virtue; I have flowered forth like a rose planted by the brooks of water.
