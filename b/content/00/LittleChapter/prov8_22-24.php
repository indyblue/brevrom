Prov. 8:22-24
Dóminus possédit me in inítio viárum suárum ántequam quidquam fáceret a princípio. Ab ætérno ordináta sum, et ex antíquis ántequam terra fíeret. Nondum erant abýssi, et ego jam concépta eram.
The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made any thing from the beginning. I was set up from eternity, and of old before the earth was made. The depths were not as yet, and I was already conceived.
