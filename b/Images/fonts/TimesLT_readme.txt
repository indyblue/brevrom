Font characters:

(applies to upper and lower case)
ô = oe  (non-accent)
õ = oe' (accent)
ã = ae' (accent)
Ð/ð = M/m~ (m-tilde)

the script I wrote uses the backwards apostrophe (`) and the tilde (~) for the hotkeys.  Thus typing 
a`
will result in
á
the non-accented dipthongs are created by
oe` and ae`
the accented dipthongs are created by
oe~ and ae~

the m-tilde is created by either
m~ or m`

These characters will only show correctly if you are using my custom TimesLT font.  Otherwise the four custom characters above will show as their native characters.  This isn’t a problem, and no cause for worry.  As soon as you change the font of the text, they will show correctly.

To activate the script, you can either associate it with autohotkey.exe, or you can drag-and-drop it.  When the script is loaded, you'll see a green "H" in the tool-tray.  You can right-click on this and click exit to shut it down.  I've added a couple of other hotkeys to the script: 
win-x to exit, and
win-z to suspend.  Suspend mode changes the H to an S, and just deactivates the hotkeys until you hit win-z again to un-suspend.
